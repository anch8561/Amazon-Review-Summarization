I have a digital one that was $50 which holds an AM station better, but has less volume. My favorite station is over 30mi away, and if I put this radio on the nightstand, I get some drift, which means I have to retune it, or at least turn the radio a bit on the stand. If I put it on the bed by the pillow, it seems to hold the station. Maybe I am an antenna? Also the tuning is quite sensative, as are most all small radios with the analog dial tuner, but this one seems to have a sturdy tuning wheel that has a built in resistance to movement which helps to more accurately tune the radio. The signal strength light helps as well. I have been using NIMH AA cells and they last for days before needing recharge. FM performance seems good, but I am not really an FM listener. For the price, this may be the best radio I have ever seen! Only 4 stars because of the minor drift issue.

The only problem with that little Transistor Radio was that Transistors drained batteries fast, and at less than 5 hours of play time; AA batteries weren't cheap to keep stocking up on back then....but fast forwarding on to today, electronics have become better since the days of a Transistor Radio. Transistors have given way to the Integrated Circuit (IC), and Sony has made a great product even better.\n The Sony ICF-S10MK2 AM/FM Pocket Radio is a far more superior product than the old Transistorized Radio I had years ago. Its compact, lightweight, and rich sound makes this radio a must have for anyone who appreciates and uses a pocket radio on a daily basis like I do. The AA battery life with the use of IC's is greatly extended to well over 70 hours of continuous play time at a soft to medium level of volume with a close AM station tuned in. This radio performs well in all conditions in all seasons in weathers fair or foul. Stations distant and local lock in nice and clean when tuning, and the tuning LED is a nice indicator to indicate signal strength. Sound is rich and crystal clear, even in noisy conditions (ie: engine noise, machinery, high wind, severe storms, ect.)\n Overall, in my personal opinion...the Sony ICF-S10MK2 is the best little inexpensive pocket radio you can buy in the $10-15.00 price range that performs superbly and wonderfully on a daily basis.

On that time, I'm only on my 2nd set of batteries! I don't use this radio daily but I do use it every week for a few hours. Over he last 6 years, it's been in a steamy shower room, dropped on concrete (from waist height), dropped off ladders (about 5 to 6 feet), baking in the sun on a hot tar roof, in a tool bag with metal tools, dropped in the dirt, banged against walls and doors...it still works perfectly! The battery compartment door is just now starting to look a little loose but it still snaps shut and stays shut. When I bought this 6 years ago, they were $10 (best $10 I've spent). Then I watched them climb to $12 and thought \"we'll it's still worth it\". Now they are up around $40 and I have to recommend shoppers step away. It's a nice little radio but it's not worth anywhere near $30 to $40. It's analog, no back light, small speaker, and not water tight. $10 or so, yeah. $30 or $40? No way!\n\nFirst off, let's put this in perspective. It's a portable AM/FM radio with a small mono speaker. It's not an awesome radio. It's a good radio for what it is.\n\nThe worst:\nThe earphone jack is LEFT channel only. Yes, as others have pointed it out you can buy an adapter to plug into it...blah, blah, blah. The bottom line is that I've had other little, mono radios that have the mono signal sent to BOTH channels through the headphone jack. So it's possible for Sony to do this on this radio too, but they chose not to. Reasons, cost, design...blah, blah, blah. Bottom line: Sony could put the mono signal to both headphone channels but chose not to...period. No need for any further discussion on it. They simply chose not to...the end. Sangean's pocket radios do play audio in both ears.\n\nThe other downside (if you consider this a disappointment on any level) is the speaker is quite small at 2\" (but I've seen smaller). Yes, you can turn the volume up loud enough to distort the speaker but in my experience, it gets quite loud before you get to that point. I don't find the speaker to be a disappointment at all. The Sangean SR-35 has a slightly larger speaker and sounds better but it's a smaller radio overall.\n\nThe best:\nI think this radio sounds VERY good for the size and it's LOUD for the size too. The 2\" speaker on this thing will fill a 660 sq. ft. room with no distortion at all!\nThe battery life on this radio is at nearly Star Trek proportions! I've changed batteries ONCE in a YEAR! I drove over 5,100 miles from Alaska to Texas and used this radio daily for several months before, during, and after that long trip and the batteries kept going. It only takes 2 AA batteries. I was using rechargeable batteries too! (which are generally considered to not be as long lasting as alkaline batteries, e.g. Duracell, etc.). Actually, I was starting to get a little creeped out by how long the batteries were lasting. It seemed abnormal and almost sci-fi.\n\nThe tuning on this radio is pretty good but not exceptional. I have used this radio in the big city of Houston, TX and while I find that I can pull in lots of stations, some over power others and I have trouble pulling in the one I want exactly. Sensitivity is good; however, separation is less-than-ideal. Part of that could be the fact that it has an analog tuner so you can't easily land the tuner directly on the freq that you want. You have to roll the dial and try to pick it up by finding the freq's sweet spot. Of course, once you relocate the radio to another room or another location within a room, you may have to re-tune to the sweet spot. Overall, though, this radio does very well pulling in both AM and FM stations.\n\nIt has your typical band width of approx. 530 - 1600 AM and 87 - 108 FM. The FM antenna is the telescopic type and is just BEGGING to get bent or broken. USE WITH CARE! Tuning and volume control is very easy via wheels on the sides of the radio. It also has a wrist lanyard which I find works fantastic for hanging the radio on a hook, screw, nail, coat hook, etc.\n\nI can't  recommend this little unit because of priceand would not buy another one in a second if this were lost or broken.

I thought it would be helpful to have this available in case of emergencies like power outages. As other reviewers have noted, it has very good long distance AM reception plus a telescopic FM antenna giving decent reception for a radio this size. The sound is mono only and also typical for a radio this small. It has an earphone jack but an earphone is not included in the package and we've had no need to buy one. Tuning is analog, not digital, but we've had no problems with this. When I bought this six years ago I put in two Duracell 'AA' batteries and it is still working. I don't use the radio much but have not yet had to change the batteries because it uses so little energy. You may want to buy one or more to keep at home, have handy in your bag or pocket, or keep in your car or in your backpack when camping or hiking. It is small and light weight so easily fits most anywhere, and you never know when it will cone in handy.

It is old-fashioned, no digital tuning or anything.  For me, the sound is really big coming out of the speaker in front.  I don't normally wear headphones or earbuds or anything, so it doesn't concern me that it has a mono sound that way.\nIt fits in my waste pack along with the other things I carry (like my Blackberry).  I just turn it up, zip it in, leave a bit exposes, and walk.  Love it!"}, "320": {"helpfulness": "5", "rating": 5.0, "text": "First off, I wouldn't really call this a \"pocket\" radio. Yes, it will fit in your pocket, but barely. I would say it's more of a \"hand-held\" radio, although it's still very, very light and portable. If you want a true pocket radio, I would take a look at the Kaito KA200 pocket radio or the Sony SRF-59 (both of which I also own and will write a review soon). The KA200 is incredibly small compared to both Sonys. However, the sound and reception of both Sonys is superior.\n\nNow, let me explain why this Sony's slightly larger physique is really an advantage (compared to the smaller KA200).\n  - 1. The speaker is larger than the KA200, which produces a much cleaner sound than the smaller speaker and gets quite a bit louder.\n  - 2. The AM reception is quite a bit better. The larger the unit, the larger ferrite bar can fit inside (AM uses the internal ferrite bar, while the FM uses the external telescopic antennae). Reception on both bands is absolutely fantastic.\n  - 3. Controls: The volume and tuning wheels are slightly larger on this radio, making them much easier to use.\n  - 4. The Sony holds larger batteries. It takes two AA batteries. A lot of the smaller radios I've seen/used take the smaller AAA size. So, I figure you would get 2-3 times the run time compared to a similar unit that takes two AAA's. Battery life is exceptional. I can't really tell you how good because I haven't been able to run out the original batteries yet.\n\nI mainly use this radio to keep up with the pro Minnesota sports teams when I'm away from a TV (cleaning, doing dishes, chilling out on the patio, etc). It's great for this. The speaker provides great sound and gets reasonably loud. It also works great for casual music listening.\n\n*PROS*\n- Small: Not really pockets size, but definitely hand-held size.\n- Reception: No complaints here on either AM or FM. In fact, this is probably this radios biggest strength. It's better than any other pocket (hand-held) radio I own. The telescopic antennae is probably about 17-18\" when fully extended. The FM antennae also tilts side to side and can be folded down along the left side of the speaker when not in use. The tuning wheel on the right side is also very easy to work with.\n- Sound: Small built-in speaker provides pretty good sound for the size. It's not going to blow your mind, buy you won't be disappointed either. Another thing I really enjoy about this radio that I haven't really seen any other reviews mention is that in the rear of the unit, there are speaker holes cut out of the plastic that gives the impression that there is an additional speaker in the back (although there is only one). This just gives the sound another avenue to escape and the effect is that it makes the sound go in all directions no matter which way the speaker is facing. This is incredibly awesome when using AM because you have you adjust the internal antennae by rotation the unit horizontally. So, even if you have to point the unit away from you to get a distant station to come in, you're not sacrificing sound.\n- Batteries: Takes two AAs. This is probably the most common battery and the easiest to keep on-hand, at least in my opinion. Battery life is ridiculously awesome too. I've had this radio for a month now and have been trying to wear out the original batteries I put in it. So far, I've used it every day and even left it on overnight a few times, and have not yet been able to kill the batteries. Awesome.\n- Tuning light helps you locate stations quickly.\n\n*CONS*\n- Can be tricky to listen to at really low volume. Under most normal listening scenarios, this is not an issue. Also, there is quite a jump between low volume and high volume. Be careful when you're turning it up while listening to earphones/headphones. Also, the volume wheel can be kind of scratchy at the very low end of the volume range.\n- Speaking of earphones/headphones, the jack is actually an \"earphone\" jack, not a \"headphones\" jack. This means that if are listening through a standard set of stereo headphones, the sound will only come out of the left side. You can buy a couple dollar adapter to make the sound come out of both sides, although it will still be mono sound coming out of each one. If you plan on listening primarily with headphones, this unit is probably not the best choice. I would recommend the previously mentioned Kaito KA200, or Sony SRF-59 (both of which have a stereo headphone jack).\n\nOverall, I have been extremely impressed with this unit, especially for the price. I believe it's the best radio you can get for around ten bucks! After having it a week, I actually bought two more as backups or in case Sony stops selling this model. This would also be a great radio to have around in case of emergencies because of its simplicity and the fact it uses AA batteries and has a long run time.

It certainly doesn't help that I bought this radio solely for listening to with headphones as most of the issues are related to that.  The loudspeaker is acceptable, though much poorer quality than my $20 alarm clock radio.\n\nPros:\n-I've used it at work for an average of probably 4 hours/day and it's still on the first set of batteries after over a month and a half.\n-Good AM reception.\n\nCons:\n-The left channel only headphone thing is really quite annoying. I got a mono to stereo adapter for it but it makes the radio a full inch wider and more awkward and it doesn't have the best connection so if I move the headphone wire too much, the radio will start playing out loud in my otherwise silent office building. Not okay. This could have been fixed at the factory for a fraction of a penny added cost. All it takes is a different headphone connector and an additional glob of solder.\n-The volume knob is absolutely unusable. I shouldn't have to hold the radio with both hands and as carefully as possible nudge the volume knob up to begin hearing anything, only to have my ear drums burst when the sound finally does show up.  And the first half turn of the dial is complete dead space, and the max volume is waaayyy beyond the distortion level. Awful.\n  Buying a set of Sony headphones with inline volume control set to minimum makes it more bearable, but still a terrible design. Not to mention they cost 150% of the price of this entire radio. They, however, are worth it.\n-I've read about people saying this radio is great because it has an external antenna and doesn't use the headphone cord for reception. Great, but not true.  I've found manipulating my antenna does next to nothing whatsoever, whereas moving the cord can be the difference between perfect reception and getting a completely different station in epic fuzz. I've also found the radio completely unusable without a 3' extension for this purpose. This wasn't always the case, and I've noticed my reception getting worse and worse day by day. Needs batteries, right? Well, a brand new set of batteries made no difference, so I'm beginning to conclude the radio is just dying before it even uses the first set of batteries fully.\n-You might think, oh, well this guy just is in a dead zone for radio and is trying to get long distance stations.  Well, that's not the case. I'm in a highly populated city listening to local stations. My big comparison is that the radio feature on my 5 year old Sony Ericsson phone gets the same station in the same spot perfectly clear without a headphone extension when this radio requires precise placement of the almost 6 feet of combined headphone cable with extension. Antenna fully up and extended is no different than folded away.\n\n2 stars for the battery life and AM reception. I would say it might be worth the money if you bought it for use without headphones, but unless you listen to talk radio only, I wouldn't be able to deal with the sound quality for an extended period.

These are pretty good backup/emergency radios, get a couple. FM dial is ridiculously far off, >2MHz out by the top end i.e. 107.1 comes in at ~105, typically 1MHz out at the lower to mid freqs. AM only tunes up to 1605kHz: there are three local stations between 1610 and 1690kHz; even my ~10-year-old tiny AM/FM radio goes there. AM dial accuracy is plenty good enough.\n\nThe AM section seems very decent for the radio's size. Sounds fine. Sometimes people use AM radios to sniff for RF noise: you don't want this one for that, it seems quite immune to much of it, much more immune than other similarly small AM/FM radios. I bought it for the AM ability, don't really care about the FM since so many gadgets have FM these days but not AM.\n\nI prefer analog tuning for \"emergency\" radios because you can tune to taste, and usually less to go wrong with the guts, plus typically very easy on batteries. If you want to know *exactly* where you're tuned, you know what kind of radio you need...and this ain't it.\n\nOdd-looking antenna installation, but actually this is superior for FM (only time you use it) because you can orient it horizontally, most very small radios don't allow that."}, "380": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Great little radio.

I'm happy with it.  :0)"}, "403": {"helpfulness": "4", "rating": 5.0, "text": "This is probably the best $10 pocket radio I've found. Details of this nice listening device...\n\nFrequency range is 87.5-108 MHz in FM; 530-1605 kHz in AM. This is standard, and stations come in pretty clear. The antenna is for FM; it extends to about 18\" long and folds into the left side of the radio. The antenna folds out, but it doesn't swivel around. I've found that reception is really good, and the antenna is necessary only in the basement. For AM, a ferrite bar antenna is built-in. Tuning is done with a dial scale; not digital. Fine-tuning with the dial is easy. A slide on the right side adjusts between AM and FM.\n\nThe radio has two speakers built in; one on the front and one on the back. They're 2-1/4\" diameter each. Sound is nice and clear. You can use headphones, as a jack is provided on the left side. However, this radio uses monoaural for headphone use; you'll only hear sound from the \"right\" ear. I fixed this by buying an adapter from Radio Shack. Specifically, you're looking for a 1/8\" (3.5mm) Mono Male to 1/8\" (3.5mm) Stereo Female Adapter. They cost three dollars. This adapter isn't necessary for speaker use; only for headphones.\n\nThe radio runs on two AA batteries. Listed runtime is 40 hours on FM and 45 hours on AM. This is with intermittent use, as running the radio until the batteries die will significantly shorten runtime. For me, intermittent runtime was 42 hours on Duracell, 41 hours on Rayovac, and 37 hours on Energizer (FM). Runtime was 47 hours on Duracell, 46 hours on Rayovac, and 42 hours on Energizer (AM). Those runtimes are on standard alkalines; rechargeables will be a little less, while lithiums will be a lot more. Running the radio without turning it off will decrease those runtimes by half.\n\nSize is 2-7/8\" wide X 4-3/4\" high X 1-3/16\" deep (71mm X 118.5mm X 30mm). The radio weighs 7 ounces (202 g) with alkalines installed. Power output is 100mW at 10% harmonic distortion.\n\nThe tune indicator lights up in red, and serves as a low battery indicator when it dims. A wrist strap is attached to the left side, and is large enough for most users. I'm guessing it's about 10\" long. The strap is made of shoestring-type cord; it's round, not flat. It's also pretty sturdy. I haven't tested my radio for drops or water resistance, but it feels like it would be operable as long as you don't throw it. The battery compartment is clearly marked for polarity and uses clean, quality springs. There's not a pull tab to remove the batteries, but it's not necessary. The battery compartment closes with a non-captive slide-on piece of plastic. It retains well, and shaking mine didn't pop it off.\n\nIn short, this is a great radio. The sound is excellent (considering the size) and it works every time I turn it on. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because I had to buy an adapter for headphone use. This isn't just a defective unit; I have three more of these and they're all the same. Some users here have mentioned it on theirs as well. But, it's a $3 fix.

How good (or bad) could it be? I was blown away. First off, it doesn't feel like a 10 dollar no-name brand \"drug store\" radio, it actually feels well made. No flex in the plastic case, all the controls are tight. Very well made.

It's small size makes it easy to tote in your coat pocket or bag. A pair of AA alkalines last a MONTH of daily use, several hours a day. Can't beat that. The only downside is the AM frequency coverage only extends to about 1690, we have a station here in ATL on 1690, and it barely makes it there. Don't know why Sony omitted some of the extended AM band. I've since found the service manual online (yeah I was amazed, a service manual for a 10 dollar radio!) with alignment instructions and was able to tweak the front end to get up to 1710.

I have a beater truck with a busted radio so I wanted to have a backup to use in the vehicle, in case I needed it, but this radio let me down in not one, but two emergencies.  I am scratching my head regarding the Storyteller's review because this seems like a $10 radio to me.  Let me explain.\n\nIf you are getting this as an emergency radio, then move along and get a Sangean DT-400W (which I purchased and is much better, of course! slap to the forehead) or some other quality radio that will perform under pressure.  Here's what happened to me:  We had massive amounts of rain and flooding and I had to drive home, knowing that there might be some road closures and accidents the news was VERY important to me.  So I'm driving in the dark trying to listen to this radio and it was almost impossible to keep it on an FM station, forget about an AM station, and I had to fidget with the tuning knob all the time to get something barely understandable to crackle over the speaker.  I could get about every other word.  This radio let me down and turned out to be too delicate and finicky to work in an emergency when my focus really had to be on the road.  It would be the same if you were on foot I imagine.\n\nAlso, it let me down in a hurricane for similar reasons, not a good radio when you can't sit down with your cup of tea, place your delicate watch makers gloves on, put in a jeweler's loop and attempt to get this radio adjusted to a station.\n\nNot a good choice for the elderly since it takes microscopic precision movements to tune FM stations, and AM stations are essentially on top of each other and very difficult to lock onto.  Every nano-meter of movement on the dial and it seems like three stations go by.  The volume is similar, to where there is off/instant loud, and then blaring puke.  The usable volume range is about 1/100th of the volume dial as the rest is not useful.  I really wish they could separate out the tuning wheel a bit, because it seems like a quarter turn gets you all the way across the spectrum of available bandwidth.\n\nGet this as a toy or perhaps cheap radio for the kids to break, maybe a backup, but I don't want to have to rely on this radio again since it is so difficult to use under stress.  I would rather spend a little more and have a back-lit LCD screen, and presets.  I tried to go cheap and got cheap.

I do not say this very often, but I think everyone should get one. I originally bought this as emergency equipment. In the end, its nostalgic value outweighed its practical value. You get much more value than you can reasonably expect from its status as a cheapo-plastic-made-in-China-junk consumer item.\nWhen there is a power outage, if you can find 2 penlite (AA) batteries somewhere in the house, you can still listen to the radio. During the Loma-Prieta Earthquake, all radio stations except 2 were knocked off the air (yeah, and both play elevator music). This thing will enable you to easily scan the dial to find stations that manage to get back on the air for emergency info.\nDIALS AND SWITCHES\nThere is a volume/off dial, a tuning dial, and a AM/FM switch, just like the first pocket radio I got as a kid. Judging by the solid, smooth mechanical operation of these, I expect many years of reliable usage. There is also a telescoping antenna (which I never use, since I am in a major metropolitan area, SF/Bay Area), a carrying loop (which I have never seen the use of, even as a kid or adult), and a Tuning LED (which I never use, since I tune by ear, not by LED).\nSOUNDS GOOD\nThe high quality from the teeny-tiny speaker was the most surprising quality of this rather remarkable pocket radio. It was at least as good as your typical clock-radio, not only for voice news but also jazz. As long as you are locked on to a strong signal, you can enjoy several hours of stuff without listening fatigue.\nMANY RADIO STATIONS\nWell, now: getting only a few radio stations is the Achilles Heel of most `pocket radios' you can buy these days. These use mainly a `AM/FM radio on an IC chip' sort of technology. This cheapie, generic chip has tuner sensitivity that is pretty crappy.\nWhen I was a kid, you had to remove the entire back panel to replace the battery. When you did this, you saw that most of the interior volume was taken up by one, huge printed circuit board chocked full of discrete, electronic parts: ceramic capacitors, electrolytic capacitors, carbon film resistors, diodes, and, hopefully, several transistors (you young `uns have no idea what a `transistor' is, do you? 2N103? Germanium PNP?). This type of tuner got many, many stations, no problem to get a specific one in your area that you wanted.\nUsing the ICF-S10MK2, I was surprised to get the same number of stations as the old, discrete solid-state radios. Yes, I took off the back panel. Sadly, the PC board was face-down, otherwise I would give you the model number of the IC chip, since I was not in the mood to undo the circuit board mounting.\nBATTERIES\nThis is the most important feature of this pocket radio. According to the instructions, a new set of alkaline 2 pieces of AA batteries, you get 40+ hours. I took a couple of penlites from the dead-battery-box, and got several hours of use, and they are still there, giving me use.\nIt does not use the old, expensive, hard to find 9 volt batteries. This wonderful radio can even use those rechargeable AA NiMH batteries.\nEVERYONE CAN HEAR IT\nIn this age of iPods and BlueTooth, it is easy to forget that others cannot hear your thingamajig, especially in an emergency. With the ICF-S10MK2, everyone within a few feet or in the same room can hear it.

If you don't know what that is, it means that it will only work in one ear of the headphones.  I was very surprised that anything is still made using that technology, as it was rare to find it in most products many years ago.  I never would have thought to check that about it in product specifications or reviews.  In some ways I find it unacceptable that such an antiquated technology was used.  It seems as though this is a warehouse item that sat somewhere for 30 or so years.  If it actually was commissioned and produced in this era, I can't imagine why they would have used mono.  I confess that I thought the headphone jack was broken until I read other reviews saying that this is how it is meant to function.\n\nAside from that, it is slightly too big to put in a pocket, even a fairly large pocket.  The reception is very much like the reception of a handheld radio from the 1980's or 1990's.  It works, but it's very particular about the direction it's in, and no matter what it will likely go in and out a little bit.  It's much better if you wrap aluminum foil around the edge of the antenna, or use a wire coat hanger to extend the antenna's reach.  These are things I did 15 or so years ago, and not since, but if you do these things it will work fine.  The part that allows the antenna to swivel is very flimsy.  I would suggest never moving the antenna from its base position as this is generally not necessary.  You will improve reception better by wrapping the end of the antenna in foil than extending it - at least in my use.  I use my radio in new york city, where most radio stations are fairly strong.  The situation may be very different elsewhere.\n\nAs an aside, you must turn the tuning and volume dials like you're disarming a bomb or performing brain surgery because a fraction of a millimeter is the difference between many bandwidths and many decibels.  If you are very very careful though, you can go down to a low volume.  I comment on this because another reviewer had said that it was impossible.  It is not impossible in my hands, but challenging.  This was a common engineering style in electronics when I was a kid.\n\nAll of that taken into account, I really like the way it looks, even with foil around the edge of it.  And I can listen to NPR on it on the way to and from work, which is why I bought it.  It also comes with a warrantee which I think is extremely impressive.  The sound quality is also not bad, especially not bad considering the price.\n\nOverall, if you desire to relive 1988, this is perfect.  And I don't mean the sexy 1988 of revivalist culture, I mean real 1988.

Maybe I've just come to a point in my life when I can appreciate something less than surround-sound and high-fidelity.  This, my friends, is simply a terrific - let me say that again - TERRIFIC little radio.  Keeping in mind that this is a small, inexpensive, and very, very basic transistor radio with one small speaker:\n\nReception:  Has proven to be outstanding.  Sensitivity is high and I can receive remote stations in a canyon setting that my car audio has trouble picking up.  No digital here, folks, this baby is pure analog:  With only an old-school linear display depicting the frequency, you've got to dial in the stations yourself with the tuning dial and judicious directional placement of the antenna.  (or of the device itself, as FM comes in through the metal aerial but AM tunes through a directional ferrite metal rod inside the radio)  Tuning in a weak signal, therefore, requires a good ear and certain finesse of the finger.  For the size and power of the unit, however, reception is excellent.\n\nSound:  Is adequate for a device sporting two AA batteries and one small speaker.  Well, let me say this:  It is more than adequate in a small space like a garage, or when in close proximity as outside in the back yard, or even outside at a distance if you crank the volume and it doesn't have to compete with a lot of background noise.  The speaker is small and low power, however, and this will never be able to compete with a lot of background noise.  Passing jet planes, leaf blowers, or the cabinet saw in your garage will cancel this little guy out.  But then, so would it also just about any other radio you might be listening to.  Basically, the sound is well-matched to the device and I doubt anyone would find it unsatisfactory.\n\nPricing:  Totally reasonable at around 12 to 15 bucks, but a veritable steal if it sinks to single digits.  Considering size, weight, portability, reliability, and downright enjoyment of this radio, the bang to buck ratio is huge.  Huge.\n\nBattery life:  Is incredible.  So much so, that I have abandoned all my hand-crank emergency radios in favor of a couple of these.  A single set of good quality AA batteries has lasted me months.  Use has been occasional, but certainly for hours at a time and often for days at a time.  And they are still going.  So, why would I want a cheap hand-crank radio of dubious quality for emergencies when I could have an outstanding little transistor radio of excellent quality which could run for days and days on a single set of batteries?  Right, I wouldn't.  Besides, I can't be the only one out there envisioning that teeny, flimsy plastic crank snapping off just when you're trying to receive critical emergency info.  High quality alkaline batteries are the ticket for this radio, but in my opinion the best way to go are these:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Sanyo-Eneloop-8-Pack-AA-NiMH-Pre-Charged-Rechargeable-Batteries/dp/B000LNI5VC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sanyo Eneloop 8 Pack AA NiMH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries</a>&nbsp;Once charged, they stay charged for a long time and they last a looooong time in small electronic devices like this.  Charge up a half-dozen to keep on hand for emergencies and back up.\n\nOther thoughts:  This radio does not come with a cord to plug into the wall, but then it doesn't need one.  it does have a small jack for headphones (mini jack) if you are so inclined.  Use is really, really easy:  Pull up the antenna, turn the dial on the side for on/off function and volume, use the other dial for tuning, and adjust antenna and dials to suit your experience.  The unit is small - No, not ipod small - about the size and weight of a man's moderately-stuffed wallet.  You know, the kind that makes your back ache if you are sitting on it for an hour's commute.  It's a handsome little unit, too:  Just what one might imagine a small Sony transistor radio would look like.  Simple.  Clean.  Sharp.\n\nLastly, the experience.  Yes, it's a great companion sitting on your workbench as you sharpen your tools or fix your child's toy.  Certainly, it can be a lifesaver during an emergency when the power goes out and you really, truly need to know if you should get out of town.  Absolutely, it is a great thing to have in your truck's console storage for whatever:  desert camping; working that desolate jobsite on a weekend...  But, the best - just positively the very, very best - place to have this radio is with you in the back yard.  With a beer in your hand on a summer afternoon.  Listening to a baseball game under a shade tree.  Folks, if that doesn't transport you to another place then I don't know what will.\n\nOne last thought.  Do you really need this with all the internet and cable and ipods laying around?  I've got all that, and more MP3 players than I care to count and I say unequivocally yes, you do need this radio.  Because when every other device and situation around you isn't, you will appreciate something that is simple, uncomplicated, and reliable.  Aside from all its other attributes, these qualities alone make it worthwhile.\n\nFive stars."}, "609": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "I love this little radio. I use it all the time.

This baby is perfect for that, and is $10 very well spent. If that is what you're looking for, quit reading and hit the \"Add to Cart\" button. It receives a clear AM signal (15 miles away) from all angles, sideways, upside down, backwards, inside out. I tied a neck lanyard to the wrist strap, to avoid slipping out of my shirt pocket when I bend forward, but otherwise it's a perfect basic no-frills radio.\n\nBuyers should know that this is NOT a stereo radio, it is indeed MONAURAL, just like the good old days. Us greybeards don't find this that unusual, and used to listen with single earplugs, but modern consumers may find it odd. Just know that you'll only hear through one (left) earphone, not both. I understand there are adapters available to split the signal to both ears, but it will still be mono. I often like to listen with only one ear anyway while doing lawn work, so it happens to be fine with me, YMMV. The volume control works fine, though there is speaker distortion at the very high end (too loud to listen to from the pocket anyway).\n\nThis radio indeed feels just like those made 6 decades ago, so go ahead and feel the joy. If you start hearing 50 year old radio broadcasts, though, check and make sure you haven't slipped into The Twilight Zone. Just walk backwards, exactly the way you came in, and you'll be fine.\n\nFM reception seems fine. The antenna seems okay, but I didn't test either of these extensively since I was only interested in AM. In most radios with this design (tuning with a side wheel) it's a little too easy to bump the station off center, and you'll have to remember the volume wheel is on the left.\n\nDo I wish it had digital tuning, station presets, and a lock button? Sure, but I didn't expect to find these in a ten buck radio, so no disappointment there.\n\nSo again, this radio is perfect for AM talk radio on speaker. It might be a good choice to fill out a $25 free shipping order, if you already have a light mine (Striker OO105 Magnetic LED Light-Mine).

The review is pretty simple and I'm only reviewing the AM Band part of the radio.\n\n1.  The radio is remarkably sensitive in the AM band for a little $10 radio.  Sitting on my front porch in Central California I could easily pick up Las Vegas (720 AM) and KFI in Los Angeles both of which were very stable signal receptions - Full Quieting even.\n\n2.  The Radio has nice clear tone.\n\n3.  The tuning scale is a little tight so it takes a little patience to locate weaker signals - but they are there.\n\n4.  The radio has a little red tuning light that shows when you pass an AM signal.  You can use the light to set the tuning dial to maximum signal.  It can also be used to orient the radio to obtain maximize antenna coupling/orientation to the station you're trying to listen to for maximum signal strength.\n\n5.  The radio has a VERY directional antenna located inside of the case.  This means if you're trying to tune a weak station, you may not hear it until you rotate the radio a bit on it's \"long axis\" to get the antenna pointed in the correct direction.  You have to work with it a bit - It ain't FM.  The external whip antenna has nothing to do with receiving AM Signals.\n\nConclusion:  Concerning the AM Section of this unit, this is the best little $10 radio I've had since I broke my wonderful little 1970's RCA pocket transistor.  This Sony would actually make a pretty good DX radio (DX = Long Distance Reception) for a radio enthusiast determined to pick up weak, distance signals on the confines of a little pocket radio.

I haven't found a good pair on Amazon, but there is a decent, $3.95 pair at scansound.com called \"Mono Earbud Style Headphone.\"\n\nAs others have noted, the radio has a jumpy (sensitive) volume control. A good solution is to get an attenuator/level controller, like this:\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Shure-Level-Attenuator-Listening-Level-Controller/dp/B00029U0X6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Shure Level Attenuator Listening Level Controller</a>\n\nWhen you consider the cost of accessories, it puts the radio's $10 purchase price in a new light.

What's funny about that is that I went into Walgreens specifically looking for a digital camera that was NOT a Sony,to replace my broken one. Ended up with another radio,like I really needed one. :) I was an electronics repair tech for over twenty years,and I normally know what to expect from various brands. Normally,it is ALL PANASONIC for this guy. Sony's are fine,unless moving parts or picture tubes are involved. :) But I remembered seeing positive reviews for this particular radio online,and there it was hanging in front of me for [...] bucks. I had no choice.\n\nI'm in the Outer banks right now,where there is a pretty good opportunity to really test a radio,and while it does not have the performance or sound quality of a Superadio,it does a very good job for a \"pocket\" radio. I was interested in how the thing would handle AM. Not many radios have a very sensitive or good-sounding AM section,but this unit is fairly sensitive and sounds as if it rolls off up around 8-10 khz! So there is some treble there. To me,it's inexcusable to bother building an AM radio if you're going to cut the frequency response off at around 3000 hz,and many manufacturers do. It falsely gives the impression to some that AM naturally sounds bad,and it absolutely doesn't,if any thought went into the radio's design. It shouldn't be easy to tell the difference between AM and FM,even though it's a lot easier to have a good-sounding cheap FM tuner than a good-sounding cheap AM one. Alright,enough said on that. :)\n\nThe Sony radio is attractive,has a built-in \"tuned\" LED,which is unusual and really cool for a hand-held. It runs on two AA batteries,and has a telescopic,SWIVELING rod antenna. Again,unusual,but nice.\n\nAnother thing that is a definite plus,which astounds me that none of the other fine reviewers noted it,was that this radio has a bright silver finish,which helps reflect harmful UV rays back into the atmosphere where they can't melt our world or kill off our parents or grandparents from premature aging.

This radio is sensitive enough with a frighteningly long whip antenna for its size.  It distorts at a volume just slightly higher than comfortable listening at arm's-length.  It sounds much better than the Kaito but not as good as the Sony shower radio.\n\nThere are some things I don't like about the radio.  For one, the antenna only sweeps left-to-right.  It does not swivel, and swivelling it will break it.  Second, in the lower third of the FM band the radio picks up its own internal electronic noise and creates a \"hum\" as you raise the volume.  This doesn't happen in the middle and top end of the FM band.  This isn't such a big deal for my application because I would just move my FM transmitter's frequency into the non-noisy area of the band.  However, if you like listening to things like NPR that are on the low end of the band you cannot turn the volume too loudly without this humming interference.  Finally, the earphone jack is wired for monaural headphones so the ubiquitous stereo headphones will play out of one speaker, and very quietly in the other speaker.  I bought it for non-headphone use so this doesn't really matter to me.  It does work fine with the C.

Crackling noises, the sound cutting in and out, not being able to get it to play on a low volume setting.....ie, it was either blaringingly loud (usually with crackling noises and sudden volume bursts etc..) or nothing at all.  So over the last few years, I've bought other pocket radios searching for a great radio that would last a few years.  Sadly, I've had little luck finding such a radio, despite having bought some \"good ones\" at Radio Sh%^ for a LOT more than this one, and some \"cheapies\" here and there.  So, getting very frustrated and while doing research here on Amazon, I came across this one again, and with all of the great reviews, I thought I'd give it another chance.  \"Maybe I dropped the last one a time or two too many\", I figured.  \"And for $10, if I get another year out of it, it would have been worth it.\"  Well, it lasted less than ONE MONTH this time.  It was great UNTIL suddenly the speaker didn't work anymore.  I'm not sure why, but it \"broke\" shortly after I used it with an earpiece plug-in.  I used my Nokia (phone) hands-free headset with an adaptor to fit the standard jack in this Sony pocket radio...and it worked fine for the first day or two.  Then, all of the sudden, there was no sound coming from the external speaker.  I don't know how or why this happened, but something is now amiss.  It would seem that the jack has been \"damaged\" by the headset plug / adaptor and somehow, this renders this speaker dead.  But why, and how?  There was, as far as I know, no reason that this happened.  And with the external speaker not working, this radio is nearly useless to me now and I am sending it back to Amazon.  So, two of these for me, and both unsatisfactory.  When it works, it's GREAT.  Very clear signal.  Nicely built, SEEMS solid.  But watch out.

My sturdy no-name has a robust mid-tones sound, with subtle gradations of audio clarity all the way from 1% to 95% volume. Since earbuds don't stay put for me and earbud cords get in the way of what I'm doing in the garden/yard/workshop or on a ladder, I rely on a speaker radio that fits in a shirt/jacket/toolbelt pocket. Outdoors, it needs to overcome ambient urban noise; alternatively, while tent camping or indoors at pillow time it needs to be very quiet (preferably almost subliminal!). I use it everywhere (MN public radio is tops!). But someday it will stop working, so I needed to find a decent low-cost backup, and am happy to have found the Sony ICF-S10MK2.\n\nSo relative to the above: I find the ICF-S10MK2 sound has a mid-treble tone, not so robust, but it projects well across hard surfaces/floors/etc. The case backside is also perforated, which interestingly makes the sound seem to project in all directions. OTOH, this also means the sound can't be directed away from someone nearby. The Volume Range has problems: it distorts badly beyond 70% volume, so I've yet to determine if it can overcome much outdoor noise when set a few feet away (rather than in a pocket). At the low end, there seems to be no output for the first 10% turn of volume dial, then only a single spot that may qualify as very quiet, but then jumps to a distinctly louder range up through 70%. This lack of volume gradations at the minimum end may make it somewhat unsatisfactory for bedtime use near-ear for whisper-quiet output."}, "845": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "I'm not sure that I have ever purchased anything that was a better value than this.

That little AM radio Santa brought me was one of my favorite childhood gifts. I used to marvel at the little box that could bring in programs from afar late at night when I was supposed to be asleep under the covers - well I was under the covers anyway. Then decades later, I recently wanted a small Trans. radio for storms & such and discovered the ones like I had were now hard to find in the stores, and the couple I did find were terribly cheap and didn't perform well- even for a pocket radio-  So I surfed around and this looked to be the best bet for performance and value. I was not dissapointed- after buying this here for a reasonable price, I later found it locally and bought two more. I have to say its about as good as it could be at this price.  This little sonys tuner pulls in and holds stations like a bulldog, the speaker sounds good for its size, has a good quality foldown antenna, A-1 build quality on the case and the battery door fits nice and tight with no fear of losing it. I do remember the old pocket radios all used to come with an earphone and this one didnt, but other similar examples i looked at didn't either so I won't call that a negative-- but be advised, as with all traditional pocket radios in the past, this radio has single channel/single speaker mono sound, not stereo. So if you use todays stereo earbuds only the left side will play, this is normal as it is a basic mono radio.  If you want stereo sound you have to buy a stereo radio.  I know its only a pocket radio, but Im a gadget as well as retro freak, and I love a good value, something that works as promised and this does just that-- If this is the type of radio you're looking for I recommend it highly. Now in my older years I find myself revisiting my childhood, laying in bed just as decades ago listening to quiet music and talk shows, thinking of that radio \"Santa\" brought me so many years ago.

Using a tunable AM loop antenna with the Sony improved both the reception and fine tuning issues for the AM band, but I can't see myself frequently carrying a loop antenna around wherever I might want to take a portable radio, and this provides no help with improving signal strength on the FM band.

It's the size of an average cassette/walkman, so harder to lose than some mp3 players, but also not as comfortable/convenient to carry around. Most annoying; the volume dial is super sensitive and can go from zero to blast with a simple touch, so adjust carefully if you've got earbuds on.

It's a nice companion on an outside job, at a work location where there is no available electricity, or just to listen to the ball game on the deck.  I don't want to just repeat all the positives everyone else has mentioned - except to say that I agree.  The highlights of my own \"Pros\" would include the little red \"tone\" light to assist in attaining the best signal - the relative tightness of the wheel to change stations - no station drift, and the surprisingly good sound.  There, I'm doing it - agreeing with many others.  I did buy the \"Frequently Bought Together\" package of this radio and the Sony ICF-38 AM/FM portable radio.  This ICF-38 portable has better sound, but is more than twice the price of the ICF-S10MK2.  Still an inexpensive duo though.  The ICF-38 is good on the kitchen counter, while I appreciate the S10MK2 for the reasons already mentioned. I have no regrets in the purchase of the two.  Also, I actually purchased three more of the S10MK2.  One for my carpenter son, one for a friend, and one for the glove compartment.  That one has lithium batteries installed.  I guess I'm well covered, but I do use a radio quite a lot and I'm very pleased with each of these.  None of them compare with a high-end stereo system, but that's not why I bought them.  How could you go wrong for the price?  Buy one and see if you like it.  You may purchase one or two others.  Highly recommended, and I hope you enjoy yours.\n_____________________\n\nFifteen months later - I came back to purchase another S10MK2 as a gift for a friend to use on jobs where it would be practical.  I was really surprised to see the advertised price at over sixteen dollars, plus shipping.  I paid a few pennies less than ten dollars in May of '09, and got free shipping on this order.  This S10MK2 is still a good radio, but I don't know as I would spend this $16+ price for it. I have the feeling I could get something comparable for less money.  Either that, or I'll get the ICF-38.  The S10MK2 is more suited for a job site though, but I just can't get around a 100+% increase in price (with shipping). It's not a lot of money, I know, but it's not the great bargain it used to be either. I probably shouldn't be so stubborn for around $20, but it's the principle of the thing.\n______________________\n\nWell, I had to mention this:  Just looking in electronics and I see that the ICF-S10MK2 is now (Sept '10) offered for $12 with free shipping.  I guess you have to be in the right place at the right time when looking for an item.  I would have bought it at this price - it is a great little radio for the back yard or work site.

Kid friendly, easy to operate and inexpensive enough to not worry about them dropping it.\n\nCons: Plastic case could have been made thicker. feels very flimsy compared to the same Sony type models of the early 80's.\n  Antenna is too rigid and does not rotate in all directions.\n  NO STEREO! Though this is not a necessity for an emergency radio, stereo through the headphone port would have been a real selling point and will only cost Sony a few extra cents to upgrade the circuitry.\n  FM sensitivity really weak and prone to overload and IMD from nearby FM broadcast towers.\n\nOverall, I have no reservations about the purchase of this radio for anyone. It's a good little radio and worth having one around. Not a real performer for those who want a compact portable radio, but it is well worth the $11 price for it.

This is Not the case with the Sony ICF-S10MK2.\n\nAlthough on the radio I purchased, there seems to be a rather high level of built in noise between stations when tuning on the AM Band.  This noise is quieted however when a station is tuned in.  The AM sensitivity on this radio is quite good for a radio of this price and I am at a distance from major broadcasters in this area.  FM sensitivity and selectivity are good as well.\n\nObviously you can not expect a radio of this size and price to have High Fidelity  \" Boom Box \" type sound.  For its size and price however the clarity and quality of sound especially when listening to voice programs like News and Talk Radio I find nothing short of excellent.  Music is good too although you have to remember this is a small radio but in a quiet room you can hear it all over the room without having to turn the volume up all the way.\n\nThe tuning indicator light on the front of the radio is another plus.\n\nFor AM reception the built in  ( presumably a ferrite bar type antenna ) is directional so positioning of the radio will make a difference in AM reception.  This is a characteristic of this kind of antenna so it is to be expected and adds to the AM sensitivity in picking up stations that are not local to the listener.\n\nThis is one of the very few occasions where a budget priced pocket sized radio performs as good as it looks.  At this price you just can't go wrong. I am buying a second one of these and maybe a few more as gifts for friends.

It gives me everything that I could ever ask for from a pocket radio. When I bought it, I had a hard time deciding between this Sony and the Panasonic RF-P50, so I eventually just bought them both. I'm guessing that I'm not the only person who found themselves trying to make that particular decision, so I'll go ahead and do a side-by-side comparison.\n\n  They are both basically the same size. In your hand, the Sony feels like it's a bit bigger, but they're the same size. The Sony feels slightly heavier, but there's no big difference between the two.\n\n  As far as their sound, the Sony has more high end, and it sounds brighter, in a good way. The Panasonic sounds warmer without that extra bit of high end. Both sound good, and I think that anyone would be happy with either.\n\n  The Panasonic has a wider tuning dial, so it seems a bit easier to do fine tuning on it, as opposed to the Sony's more narrow dial, but it's not like that's really a problem.\n\n  The Sony definitely has more sensitive reception. It picks up distant stations noticeably better than the Panasonic. The Panasonic is perfectly fine with local stations, but the Sony is far superior when trying to tune in weaker signals. I was actually amazed with the Sony's superiority when I did a side-by-side comparison. The Panasonic isn't terrible, but the Sony has amazingly good sensitivity.\n\n  Those are the main differences, as far as I can tell. Both have a red tuning light. Both feel like they are solidly built. They both have the same kind of wrist strap and antenna, and they are both well worth the money.\n\n  Personally, I much prefer the look and feel of the Panasonic, but the superior reception sensitivity of the Sony is a big deal to me.

Not that $10 is a lot to spend, and I figured I could give or throw it away if I wasn't happy with it.  Perhaps the other reviews listed here gave me false hopes, because I'm certainly not too happy with the performance of this product.  First, it doesn't come with an earphone, so I had to go to Radio Shack to get one, which cost me another  $4.00 plus tax (that's over 40% of the product price, just for a cheap accessory!)  I could have bought one from Amazon for $0.99, but since it wasn't part of the \"Super Saver\" program, they wanted to charge me $12.00 to ship it, even if I ordered a bunch of other stuff that WAS part of the super saver program!!  Well, I thought, for about $15 bucks if it works, well, I'll still be happy.  I bought it to keep me company at work in an overnight job in a warehouse for one of the nations top three retailers.  I've used my ipod in the past, but there are some radio programs (thanks NPR and Air America) that I like to listen to, so I thought this would be perfect.

On my car and home radios, I receive dozens, if not hundreds of radio stations.

To read a review of its startling capabilites, Google these terms together: \"radiointel sony pocket radio\".\n\n2) Some reviewers, I imagine under 40, don't know what this is.  It's a transistor radio.  Before the Walkman, this was it for portable musical entertainment.  From the mid-50's until the early 80's, they ruled.  (It's a bit freaky that they are now so hard to find.  I checked Radio Shack for the FlavoRadio.  They don't make it anymore!)  They eventually became very inexpensive, and the operation of various models was practically identical.  One thumbwheel for on/off and volume, and one thumbwheel to tune.  That was it.  It of course was monoaural, and an earplug was always supplied.  Sony's earplug was the best; it had a little bend in it at just the right angle so that it fit perfectly in your ear and stayed there.  It was grey with a transparent ear tube.  All the others had a straight plug that immediately fell out of your ear.  They were an ugly beige.  Anyway, those reviewers who were shocked that the fm is mono don't understand the nature of this genre.  This is not a new twist on an fm walkman, (hey, a walkman with a speaker!).  This is a transistor radio.  However, it doesn't come with and earplug.  Walkman style headsets can be used, but sound will come only from the left side.\n\n3)  Fit and finish is lacking.  The plastic is the cheap brittle kind (not the thick resilient kind).  Also, the volume doesn't kick in until the thumbwheel is turned somewhat past the lowest volume.  They you can turn the thumbwheel back to get lower volume.\n\n4)  I've had this radio for a week now, and have barely surfed the internet at night, as is my wont.  Listening to distant am stations has a surfing-the-net quality to it (inasmuch as you forever stumble upon the unexpected), but there's MORE:  The station you are listening to will invariably fade out, often succumbing to signal that has just become more powerful in your area (due to the ebbs and tides of the ionosphere).  It's as if someone popped out of nowhere, grabbed your mouse, and clicked a link.  Passive surfing.  It is surreal, and I just might replace my pricey broadband connection, with its never ending monthly bill, with this $10 dollar one-time fee (plus another $20 for the eneloop/charger combo I bought at the same time).\n\n5)  Oh, yeah...

The right side is the tuning. There is a earphone jack but the radio came with none. I have yet to buy one.

I've purchased many small radios over the years, and this one is by far one of the most sensitive ones I own.\n\n  Reception on both AM and FM is terrific, with great selectivity. It easily tunes into adjacent stations which come in very clear, almost as good as on a larger radio. There is an LED on the front to show when a station is tuned in, and the FM antenna can be extended and moved from side to side to get better reception. AM tunes up to about 1630 or so, rather than all the way up to 1710, but this probably won't be a big deal for most people, since there usually aren't many stations on that high end of the band. The carry strap is convenient, and the radio is very small and lightweight so it can easily fit just about anywhere. Sound quality is good also- it's actually a little fuller than other small radios, and has decent clarity without being tinny. I do have one complaint, however- in strong FM areas the local stations tend to come in all over the dial, allowing for very little reception of the weaker ones. Unfortunately this is a problem where I live, and because of that I only use this radio once a year when I go on vacation to the beach. It does an amazing job there since there are no strong stations in that area, and it's disappointing that I can only get good reception there and not where I live.\n\n  Overall I would highly recommend this Sony radio. I also own Panasonic's current model, the RF-P50, and while it also has a Sony IC chip it isn't quite as sensitive as the Sony version. If you live in a weak area, definitely consider picking up one of these Sony radios. You won't be disappointed."}, "1103": {"helpfulness": "468", "rating": 4.0, "text": "I'm one of \"those people\" that always seems to have room for one more radio, even if it is roughly the same as many others I own. After reading several reviews for the ICF-S10MK2 and seeing the $10 price tag, I couldn't resist. After spending a few days of extensive listening, it has sent a few other radios to the display shelf. The Sony is a bare-bones FM/AM transistor - no clock, dial lighting, bells or whistles. The clear plastic front and splash of brushed aluminum around the dial selector give it just enough style to be noticed. Controls are kept to a minimum at volume, tuning, and band-selection. The audio quality is good, but par for a transistor radio. As long as awe-inspiring surround sound isn't expected, you won't be disappointed. The FM antenna folds out from the left side of the radio and swivels around for optimal reception. A much better option than just protruding from the top. The earphone plug on the side is mono only, and will only play in the left ear with a standard set of headphones. FM performance is good - a little too good, as the signals tend to overload a bit. Away from the city areas, FM signals come in distant and fairly well. The AM band is where this little Sony really shines. While most small radios can't cope with decent AM reception, this one goes above and beyond radios 3 times its size and 6 times the price. The AM tuner has excellent sensitivity and selectivity, and gives you the option of some tougher signal catches. I have been able to listen to a small station 35 miles away at 1140khz, while almost next to the antennas of a 50,000 watt monster at 1180. The S10MK2 performs some good feats on only 2 AA batteries, with an average listening life of 40-45 hours per set. Alot of enjoyment for little money. For a quick breakdown:\n\nPros:\n\n- Long life on batteries\n\n- Fairly loud volume without distortion\n\n- easy to operate\n\n- excellent reception\n\n- cheap price tag\n\nCons:\n\n- earphone audio in left ear only without special adaptor\n\n- minimal styling. Won't stand out in a crowd\n\n- antenna arcs, but doesn't swivel\n\n- FM selectivity not all that it could be\n\n- audio quality is OK, but not spectacular\n\n- battery door isn't hinged and could be easily lost\n\n- no option for AC power. Batteries only\n\nAlthough there are some radios that perform better than this particular Sony, you won't find any of them this inexpensive. For good listening on the cheap, make sure to get one...or two. Maybe 3 just in case."}, "1104": {"helpfulness": "8", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Fantastic radio, exactly what I was looking for.

When the station is clear, it is fine - loud and clear.  It is hard to find stations, at least in L.A. where the bands are full of stations.
