I just know what I like in terms of sound.  While the Z-2300s are good speakers, they are waaay over hyped.  Buyer beware.\n\nBefore purchasing these speakers I was using a cheap 29 watt Creative set that I have to admit gave glowing reviews to right here on Amazon.  The reason for my high marks wasn't because the system was great, it was because they were a bargain at around [...] bucks.  I had outgrown them (bigger place, now wanting to have real parties) and wanting something that both sounded good and could deliver higher volume.\n\nThe reason for the inflated reviews are probably because these are computer speakers and most common users are accustomed to their cheap [...] dollar sets (like my old Creatives) so these just blow them out of the water.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the mid-range is severely lacking.  I didn't even know what the mid-range was until I researched these speakers (after purchasing them) trying to figure out why I didn't like what I was hearing.  After I tweaked the iTunes equalizer to an arrow shape with high mids and lower bass and treble did the sound finally start to sound right for most songs.\n\nBut even with this fix, the speakers still have their issues.\n\nOne, it's almost impossible to take these to the highest volume without noticeable distortion.  I think about 75% power is about their max.  So I see this as more a 150watt set more than a 200.  I'll just never use all that power because it just doesn't sound good.  I want to stress that I did mess with the pre-amp and both the iTunes and computer volume settings.  With both of those set at about mid-power the speakers still cracked at around 75% power.\n\nTwo, there is some low hiss on songs where there isn't a lot of music to fill the space - a vocal track for example.  My connections are fine and I tested some of the highest quality tracks I had.  This isn't horrible, but I found it annoying.\n\nFor this price range this probably a good deal.  But please, don't listen to all the hype with these 5 star reviews.  I honestly wished I'd paid more money for something better.  It isn't that I think I got ripped off - I got what I paid for - it's that I was swayed by all these glowing reviews and I was expecting something that exceeded what was probably possible in this price range.\n\n*********\nUpdate: I've found with extended use that the very low hiss I described is only intermittent.  It's possible that the speakers react to inside electrical wiring in the walls, but I can't tell.  (This is not something I've encountered before with any speakers I've used.)  I've moved the speakers several times and have not been able to detect a pattern.  In any case, the hiss problem is not as bad as I thought it was.

I wasn't too pleased with the wired volume control unit (I was used to the controls being on one of the speakers).  But once I had the thing installed, I found that I actually quite liked the concept of a volume control that could be closer to me than the speakers.\n\nThe subwoofer is truly enormous though.  The reviewers kept pointing this out, but I didn't believe them.  It is gargantuan and came within an inch of not fitting in what I expected to be ample space beneath my desk.\n\nIt isn't my goal to vibrate the neighbor's windows, I just wanted reasonably nice sound when playing music or games.  When I finally turned it on (did I mention it also weighs two zillion pounds?) it sounded OK.\n\nBut it did feel like something was missing.  At first I thought it was lacking in the mid-ranges (it might be), but eventually I noticed I just had no left channel at all.  Some cable swapping experiments eventually led me to the conclusion that the wired remote control had a bad/intermitting connection in the thin audio cable, or possibly a solder point inside the unit.\n\nAt this point, I felt a little desperate, since I knew there was no way I was going to actually life the two billion bound subwoofer back out of its hole.  And that, knowing myself, I was just going to live with it, and feel like an idiot (it wasn't the world's cheapest speaker system).\n\nSo I wrote customer support a truly pathetic email, begging to get a replacement just-volume-control unit, feeling certain ahead of time that it would not be possible to do so and they would insist my mailing the whole thing back (and,of course, I don't keep the original packaging because it didn't even occur to me the unit would be defective)\n\nAnyway, after some initial interactions that sounded like the expected boiler plate \"Have you turned it on?\"  \"is it plugged into your computer\" comments, they surprised me by offering a replacement volume control.  I only had to crawl around enough to disconnect the volume control.  They provided a ups mailing label and I have lots of little boxes.\n\nSo it's back to them now, and I think they really are going to send me a replacement volume control!\n\nSo it's probably premature to celebrate, but I just wanted to illuminate the turn-around in my mood from bleak to optimistic :)\n\nSo, as to the speaker sound, I am satisfied, if not actually blown away.  but as to the customer support, I am more than pleased.\n\nI do wish, as I think I have seen others comment, that they had spent the extra nickel to have the cables have connectors at both ends, instead of just disappearing into the block of plastic.\n\nBut again, the subwoofer is monstrous, and the specifications I read didn't do that justice.\n\nMine is: 16x12x12\n\nPLus one side is the huge speaker which you presumably want to not be driving right into a wall, and I am sure you need lots of thermal clearance as well."}, "63": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Pretty much everything i wanted in a sound system....loud, distortion free, amazing bass....nothing to complain about....get one!"}, "64": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Bought this couple of weeks back.

Some people say the sats are weak in the midtones, but to me it's the lows and highs that seem weak -- the sounds just above subwoofer freqs, and again above 10KHz, are weak.  To get around this problem I replaced the Logitech satellites with Polk Audio monitor 30 speakers.  With this combination I can keep the handy Logitech desk control which also has quick sub control and headphone access, but get much richer sound.  All it took was a pair of 18gauge speaker cables with RCA connectors (cut one end off) from Radio Shack.  The Logitech+PolkAudio combination is great at a total price of about $200.  I use them for computer speakers where I do most of my listening.  The sub drives the Polk Audio speakers and does a nice job of it.  These speakers have a MUCH fuller sound in both highs and lows that the Logitech Z-2300 satellites.  I highly recommend this combination if you have room for the speakers.  I also ordered some wall mounts and when they arrive I will be able to free up more space on my desk area.

I primarily watch horror and action movies. The ambient sounds of the horror movies fill the room, and the explosions and gunfire of the action movies shake the room. It's not difficult to see why this set is THX certified.\n\nHowever, as other reviewers have pointed out, the mid range is a bit low. I find that, with my personal setup, this isn't a noticeable problem while watching movies. However, it *is* noticeable while listening to music. I'm not an audiophile, but I demand a certain level of audio quality. In my opinion, the Z-2300 speakers aren't bad, but they could definitely use some help.\n\nI use my audio player's EQ to raise the mids and the highs a bit (I raise the highs because I use the Z-2300's remote to raise the bass a little, and I don't want the highs to suffer). I also use the Noise Sharpening DSP (available for Foobar2000 on Windows) set at 28% to give the audio the impression of being a little clearer. With these tweaks, listening to music with the Z-2300 speakers is much more satisfying for me.\n\nThe only other problems I have are the size of the sub, and the short length of the cables. The sub fairly big, so make sure you have enough room under your desk for both it and your feet. The cables connecting the satellites to the sub are also fairly short, so you won't be putting them more than a several feet apart from each other.\n\nI would definitely recommend these speakers.

The bass sounded good, but it had some floor rumble that my neighbors weren't too happy with.  On top of that, I could never hear voices in movies until I'd turned the TV volume up so loud that a pen clicking would practically shatter my ear drum.  I went out and bought a little Behringer equalizer and spent a good six months playing around with the settings.  Everytime I thought I had it figured out, something would sound wrong.  Either my PS3 would sound good or the TV or the Ipod - but never all at once.\n\nThen it hit me.  The audio sources were different volumes so I'd been putting the speakers' hardwired volume control at different levels.  The mid range and high range only really come in fully when you get these speakers up above 1/4 of the volume (if you're looking at the volume, you want it turned up higher than about 10 O'Clock).  So now I just use the equalizer to keep the volume coming into the speakers low and get rid of that floor rumble, and the sound is balanced and AMAZING.  It really makes all my old movies and games and music into a whole new experience.  I'm hearing things in songs I loved that I never heard before, and DVDs are almost movie theater quality.\n\nTO SUMMARIZE:\nTurn the volume on your TV or Computer or IPod down low and the volume on the hardwired remote up to near half and you'll have no complaints.\n\nThe missing star is for the floor rumble and hardwired remote."}, "72": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "My grandson suggested this gift as a Graduation, from High School, gift.

Titusville, Florida"}, "115": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 3.0, "text": "When I was in college, I had a set of JBL Creature 2s, those Darth Vader-looking ones. They were pretty good, but, as seems to be the case with many 2.1 computer systems, the speakers seemed skewed toward rock, with good highs and nice lows, but bollocks mids. I eventually sold those, in search of greener pastures. I now have a splitter leading from my Soundblaster 24-bit sound card, one line of which leads to my headphone amp and Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pros/Koss KSC 75s, and the other which leads to my Pioneer receiver and Insignia NS-B2111s. I know, I know, Best Buy in-house brand, but don't be fooled by the label. The carbon fiber driver construction makes these puppies sound very nice. Greener pastures, indeed: the mids are lush like the jungle during a monsoon, and they have a very inviting, warm presence. But, from time to time, I find myself missing the hefty, punchy presence of a sub, and the upper tingly highs of small tweeters. Enter the Logitech Z 2300s. I always do my research when I purchase something like this (I once read a 100+ page thread on a forum about one pair of headphones), and so I'd read about the Logitech's lack of mids, etc. Logic dictates, though, that if you add speakers that have great mids to speakers that have great lows and highs, you get (ta-da!) a really nice, complete speaker system. Such was my logic, and such was my goal.\n\nSetup of the speaker system was very easy and intuitive; the two satellites plug into the subwoofer, and have color-coded cables. The subwoofer is also where you plug in the wired, accompanying remote. The cable for the remote is kind of short, and it's a special plug, so you can't easily extend it. The cables are also wired straight into the back of the speakers themselves, but fortunately, they have standard RCA male ends, so extension for these would be substantially easier. The speakers are bigger than I imagined, about six inches tall by three inches wide. They come with removable dust covers, but oddly enough, the covers sit about a quarter of an inch away from the speaker, with a lip on top to aid in dust resistance. Why not make them close-fitting? Oh, well. The 8-inch subwoofer is quite large. It's somewhere in the neighborhood of 11 inches wide by 11 inches tall by 13 inches long. It also has ceramic heat sinks in the back, which adds to the length, so it's not for the faint of butt. In addition to the power cable coming from the sub, the two satellite speaker connects, and the wired remote acceptor, the sub also has a master power button. It's an interesting setup, something which I'll reference below.\n\nThe wired remote is exactly what I need: volume control, bass control, power button, and headphone jack. Wait. Power button? Yes, another power button. That sounds kind of weird, but my theory is that this remote power button is more of a standby control than a true shutoff control. I found this out when testing my headphones. Even when you turn off the power on the remote, if you have headphones in, there's a very faint hiss in the headphones, and you can still listen to headphones. However, with regard to speakers, when you turn the power off on the remote, the speakers emit nothing, which is good. It's kind of a weird idea, but it works.\n\nSo, we've talked about the basic idea behind setup and function of the speakers. Of course, the big question is, how do they sound? Let's start with headphones. I have an amp for my cans, and the aforementioned splitter, so I decided to do some A/Bing to see if there was any difference to have the headphones plugged into the remote and into the amp. The verdict: I could find no noticeable difference. Of course, I'm no audiophile, but I figure if I can't tell the difference, then it doesn't matter where the headphones are plugged in. However, since I'll be needing that splitter for my two speaker systems, I decided to just run the amp through the remote when I want to listen to headphones, and leave it unplugged for speaker listening. I mentioned I need the splitter for the speakers, and I'll explain why in the next paragraph.\n\nSo, in the several months (couple years? Can't remember) of listening to my Insignias, I've come to really like them. They're so smooth, and the mids are fantastic. They also have a good bass response for speakers of their size, which is a nice bonus. But, a couple weeks back, I was A/Bing my speakers with my roommate's old, fatty JBL's, and I found that my speakers are excellent in terms of mids, but they are, in fact, lacking a bit in the upper highs, as well as that punchy bottom end. Thus, my search began anew for a speaker system with good highs and good lows. Did I succeed? Well, yes. Very yes. Holy fish buckets, yes. After having listened to samples of songs in my iTunes library, from Led Zeppelin to Johnny Mathis, I've determined that these speakers were meant to be together. I turn off the Logitechs, and the Insignias seem to be missing highs and lows. I turn off the Insignias, and the Logitechs sound like the mids were sucked out, Hoovered away.\n\"Where are the mids?\"\n\"Probably going through the HEPA filter right now.\"\nBut together, they sound magnificent. Phenomenal. Gorgeous. For every piece of music I could throw at them. They make my stomach a little queasy. They almost make me cry. They're that beautiful. It's like listening to music for the first time. *This* is how music should sound (at least, according to me). I get the silver trumpet highs, the jungle-lush mids, and the smack-your-face lows. So, together they sound incredible, but apart, they really need help. All the reviews I've read are true: the Logitechs have the sucks mids. They absolutely need to be coupled with a sound source possessing good mids. Likewise, the Insignias need those highs and lows to really shine. Knowing what I know now, I'd never buy the Logitechs by themselves. But, now that I have them coupled with the Insignias, they are absolutely worth the price I paid.\n\nFinal evaluation: worth the investment, but ONLY if you have a backup with good mids.\n\nP.S. In my evaluation, I have the volume of the system at around 27% or 28%, with the sub at around 25%. This is *plenty* loud enough, and maybe even too loud, for casual listening. These speakers can go loud, and in order to avoid an eviction notice from the apartment manager, I didn't test their limits.\nP.P.S. Additionally, I also noticed that speakers are very directional; they've got a fairly small sweet spot, which is fine for me at my desk, but could be an issue with larger setups. This is as opposed to my Insignias, which, for the most part, just kind of disappear into the background."}, "116": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "These are best speakers I've owned ...

My one problem is the satellite speakers.  They do sound fairly good, but I think when they were THX certified it was for movie soundtracks.  Music only sounds good, but they are full range speakers that should have been separate midrange/tweeter setups.  My best guess is they're midrange speakers with \"whizzer\" cones to produce the highs normally done by separate tweeters.

I didn't use them for a whole lot of special stuff, mainly music and gaming on my computer. Basically i got sick of the quality. Don't get me wrong, im not an 'audiophile' by any means but i want my music to sound clear and good. If it sounds good, i'm happy. I don't get too picky in regards to tweaking my settings. If it gets too 'lispy' or 'tinny', i get annoyed as any music fan should. So i decided to order these speakers.\n\nSoundwise, they're great. I rarely crank the volume out but with my settings on my comp at 50% and the speaker settings at like 30%, they sound crystal clear and quite loud for my environment. I have the sub set at about 50% as well and its plenty of bass. I don't like my bass to drown out everything else but i like a nice beat to compliment the others. I like a variety of genres from heavy metal to hip hop. So i know different styles will produce different sounds and settings but going from dmx to Down, no adjustments needed except to crank it up! :)\n\nSize and setup: setup was a breeze. No software to install. Just plug where you're supposed to and enjoy! Size was a concern when i opened the box. The subwoofer is huge! its probably about a foot high and wide but about a foot and a half or so deep. Ive got a small desk and it fit under it fine on the floor, but i did lose some leg space. small sacrifice seeing as i'm not at my comp desk for long amounts of time. But should keep that in mind. The satellite speakers are of typical 'computer speaker' size so no issues there.\n\nOverall i'm quite happy with my purchase so far.

You can compare it with other systems.\n\nI can hear the sound of my music on a half volume on the knob from outside my house, which is through 2 walls and over 20 feet away! this thing is powerful.\nThe power and the sound quality may vary by the sound card you have, though.\n\nThe bass control is very useful because some of the songs I listen to have more bass and others less, and I can easily adjust to my listening preferences.\n\nSome people in other reviews suggest the sound quality is not very good, but it is actually one of the best. Don't forget that depending on the music you are listening to you will have to adjust the sound EQUALIZER of the music player you are using which I know most people are lazy to do. If you adjust the equalizer that itself leads to a great quality of what you are listening. The speakers don't have any surround, and may be that's why they get poor reviews sometimes, but if you need surround sound (mostly for movies) why you bought this system in the first place? Don't listen to those comments.\n\nThis is so far the Best 2.1 speaker system I have found, which is perfect for listening to music and everyday computer use. And I have used more than 12 different speaker systems, I am from a musician family (my father is bass guitarist), so I am pretty familiar with sound quality and speaker power.\n\nOverall great product.

My old system used traditional speaker wire, which was appropriate so that the 4 satellites could be positioned far away from the subwoofer they connect to.

I'm not a Bose basher, and having heard some other bose systems in the past that did decent sound, I was really wanting to like their system. I mean, I *really* wanted to like them. I'm needed speakers for my media center PC, and having just replaced a larger pc unit with the tiny Dell Hybrid, I wanted to also get some smaller form factor speakers. I really liked the small size, so unobtrusive, and the Bose would've worked so well where the LCD TV is across the room from the couch.\n\nI was looking to replace an older Logitech 5.1 system, which currently only has the front left and right plugged in due to not having a good layout in the great room at my new house for rear channels. They worked well and had good sound, but I was looking for a little more punch across the board with a little better clarity for highs and mids than they could do since I listen to a lot of music on this system.\n\nI opened the Bose and unpacked, laid everything out right as my current system was, and had both systems plugged in and running, so I could just unplug the 1/8\" jack from the rear of the media center PC and swap between the two of them at will to hear the difference.\n\nSince the 80's I have used the same two songs as my \"reference\" sound checks. \"Take Me Home\" from the Phil Collins 12 inchers album since it has a good variety of percussion, highs and lows, good bass punches, and cymbals and such. It gets very good high and low frequencies right in the intro. I also use a german recording of Mozart's Concerto for Piano and Orchestra No. 23 in A Major.\n\nI heard the immediate difference in both. As so many others have reported, there's an unmistakable tinny, hollow sound from the Bose. And I half expected it just from the small speakers, because they just can't move as much air as something with more area. But the startling difference between my lobotomized 5.1 system only running 2 channels, and these Bose, was hugely disappointing.\n\nAnd I did go through my HD audio card and worked with presets, but the fact that the other speakers worked so well with the settings I had, and other ones I tried worked well, it just seemed like too much work to have to go through to force a \"slightly more expensive than comparable\" set of speakers to sound as good as \"inferior\" ones.\n\nAnd no matter what tweaking or sound settings I did, there was no mistaking the fact that they just did not sound good.\n\nSo I returned them and replaced them with the Logitech Z-2300 set since that had good reviews. And I did the same thing with my old logitech set and the new one that I did with the Bose. Set both up identically, in the same locations, and swapped the plug between them as I played the same songs. And I heard an immediate difference between the old and new ones that was even more startling than the difference between the old ones I had been using and the Bose. I really wish I had the Bose and the Z-2300's both plugged in to do side by side comparisons because it would have made the new ones sound even MORE incredible.\n\nI live in a house with some space around me so I don't have a fear of neighbors complaining to me, but I still don't pound out the volume. Sometimes I will turn it up and enjoy something, but for the most part I'm listening to low to mid level volume settings, whether TV, DVD, or music. And these 2300's perform incredibly well for all of them, where the Bose just did not compare at all.\n\nI tried, I really did, I ignored most of the posts on the audio video forums that told me not to get the Bose, because I really wanted them to work for me due to the form factor. But I wish I had followed the advice all these audiophiles were offering and saved myself a few days of wasted research and the purchase of two different speaker sets, and just bought the Logitech 2300's right off the bat.."}, "203": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Although these are the only speakers I've ever bought, they were definitely worth buying.

Hey! I still have my long ago military Px [overseas] Akai M-10 Sound On Sound with built-in amp stereo tape recorder and which weighs in at 54 pounds .. and still works to this day!] -- anyway, military nostalgia aside, my hefty Akai speakers went downstairs to assist my Hitachi big screen [the Hitachi has 8 Ohm wire speaker connectors on the back of the set --quick tip -- ALWAYS use no less than =16 gauge= speaker wire!] and that did the trick for the Hitachi big screen even without an amplifier while I took this Logitech Z-2300 system and connected it to my computer in place of the vintage stuff. What a difference in sound! I put on the old 90's vintage flick \"K2\" and when the small but quite efficient Logitech speakers picked up the crackling of the fire [!] in one scene or that subwoofer kicked in as in the scene where 'Taylor' is startled on finding 'Dallas' laying in the snow, whew! Amazing sounds! Why I held out so long before switching to the modern 2.1 stuff became the number one question! I was 'very' pleased! Can a 5.1 or 6.1 'surround system' for my upstairs big screen be far away!\n\nNow for some specifics: The subwoofer in this Z-2300 system is not light and the whole system in its package is about 36 pounds with the bulk of the weight being the subwoofer. But it does an excellent job! I like the on-desk remote too because everything can be done via the remote via the on/off switch, the blue LED \"ON\" indicator, the sub-woofer +/- adjustment knob [when the subwoofer needs to be toned down or up as the case may be and via individual taste but the fact that it 'has' a subwoofer adjustrment knob is a decided plus!] and then the large master volume knob on the remote. And finally, a headphones jack built into the remote.\n\nBTW, readers are urged to read the reviews of those folks who are heavy into audio gear and various of their suggestions work very well. For example, the tendency may be to locate the satellite speakers right next to your monitor but as various reviewers suggested, leave some space [to the extent possible] between the speakers for that both 'stereo' and 'spacial' effect and let your 'ears' be the deciding factor in terms of satellite speaker placement. In effect, when you can sit facing your monitor and can 'not' tell which left or right satellite speaker is making any more discernible volume than the other, you should be spot-on with the subwoofer on the floor and [to the extent possible] in the middle of the two satellite speakers facing your legs. Again, and all the audio scientific/technical stuff notwithstanding, let your 'ears' be the final guide!\n\nAnd this too -- I even had a second set of 'boat anchors' attached to my computer system [fed by my equally vintage Marantz 2270 receiver], vintage 100 watt [each] Kenwoods, but I got the best of two worlds by simply using a stereo 'dual' plug adapter into my computer so that if I want to use the new Logitech system, fine, it's plugged in to one side of the dual stereo plug [that goes into the computer ==or== in my case and using the Creative Labs Audigy 2 system, plugged into the sound card] but if I still want to use the vintage speaker stuff, the other side of the stereo plug adapter has the connection from my Marantz receiver! In point of fact, I could use both systems if desired since that stereo adapter plug permits 'two' audio input connections.\n\nFinally, as I do this review, the Logitech Z-2300 system appears to be on sale or at a reduced price but make sure you check out shipping costs no matter who is selling the item! And this -- OK, I admit it, I see the \"THX\" logo [as I do on various DVD's] and only now do I see that \"THX\" is not some sort of audio 'system' a la Dolby or whatever but is essentially a \"certification of audio standards\" where supposedly every effort has been made in the speakers or in a particular DVD to pick up those sounds that various CD or DVD sources produce \"as faithfully as possible\" but \"THX\" [or so says the THX literature anyway] is 'not' some special type of audio production or special differences in sound but rather a certification of certain audio 'standards' and basically speaker 'quality' to do the job. Or, conversely, DVD's carrying the \"THX\" logo but as an audio certifying 'standard' versus any sort of special audio device.\n\nDoc Tony"}, "217": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "I am very pleased with the purchase of the speakers.

We are Very Happy"}, "226": {"helpfulness": "2", "rating": 5.0, "text": "I have just purchased these speakers after searching through multiple shops looking for the best speakers for under $1000.00 (New Zealand).  I looked at Bose, Harman Kardon, Jamo, JBL, Altec Lanseng, Edifier, and Logitech speakers, (as well as a few others that are not even worth a mention) and carried my iPod to compare quality.  No I am not a 'hip hop' person, I prefer classical, swing, light rock, and popular music.  I don't rely on a beat in my music to carry the music, I prefer to HEAR the music, not just feel it.\n\nSo after looking in multiple shops and listening to the music in multiple settings I found the following:  Bose, Harman Kardon, and the JBL creature speakers had a lovely crisp base, and beautiful high pitch, but were completely lacking in the mid-range 256-4096 Hz.  This is not a problem if all you want is the beat, but it is a major problem for those of us who like music with mid-range notes.  altec Lanseng, Edifier, and Jamo had rumbly bases which did not carry a clear note, as well as missing the mid-range.  Altec also had a hum when not in use but still turned on: this appears to be one of it's consistent problems.\n\nWhat surprised me the most was that the Logitech Z 2300 speakers had not just a lovely crisp base and crystal clear tweeters but also had an excellent mid-range.  I suspect that is because they were the only speakers to have a mid range output sized speaker to go with the tweeter in the two satellite speakers.  The next best was the Logitech Z4 speakers which had a larger tweeter than the remaining brands.  I think that the Harman Kardon Soundsticks II had the poorest midrange, but that is not surprising as they had the smallest tweeters, but they were on a par with Bose for quality of base and high-range music.\n\nFinally there is the bonus of the price.  The Logitech Z 2300 was the third best priced, beaten only by the Logitech Z4 and the JBL creature II speakers.  The Z 2300 is by far the best value for money however (I purchased these for under NZ$200) and am happy that I didn't have to spend upwards of $800 for the Bose while getting better quality.\n\nReading some of the other reviews of various speakers, I note that only a few have searched as hard as I have.  I would recommend these speakers any day for the music lover and the gamer.  The only drawback is that you need a fairly big space for the subwoofer, which is 2-4 inches (5-10cm) bigger in all dimensions than any of the other subs in the range I tested."}, "227": {"helpfulness": "2", "rating": 5.0, "text": "I am a professional musician though not an \"audiophile\" in the strict sense (my main speakers at home are a lovely set of towers from Fluance's mid-range SX-HTB home theater line). I bought these for use at my desk on the strength of reviews here and elsewhere. Initially I was a bit underwhelmed. The bass seemed excessive, even turned way down, and the treble seemed overly bright, with a weak midrange that led to an overly brilliant sound. Admittedly this is the sort of bright and bassy sound that many people will prefer, but I prefer a very flat, naturalistic frequency response for the mix of classical, jazz, folk, and pop I listen to. I resigned myself to a slightly sub-par listening experience, figuring that no other speakers this compact would be much better, certainly not for the price.\n\nThen I started experimenting with placement, and I discovered that these speakers are very sensitive to both horizontal and vertical placement. Just placing the speakers directly on my desk, even with their built-in upward tilt, left my ears slightly above axis. When I raised them by about 1.5 inches (or slouched down in my chair), it was like magic. Suddenly the midrange had tremendous presence and balance. Likewise, moving my chair backwards a bit further than arm's length from the speakers (which are about 24\" apart, dictated by the constraints of my desk layout) created a seamless stereo soundstage. I just listened to Bruckner's Seventh Symphony and heard details in the performance I have never heard in years of listening on my stereo speakers. Unfortunately I can't arrange my desk to get that perfect horizontal separation all the time, but the vertical positioning solves 90% of the problems I initially experienced.\n\nIn short, these turn out to be, as many people have said, brilliant speakers in the best sense--if you can put them in exactly the right place. And for many listeners, especially those who listen mostly to popular music, they will seem fantastic right out of the box, because they can go to eleven. :) I'm very happy with my purchase . . . now I just have to get some work done!"}, "228": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "If you want the best 2.1 speakers for your computer, this is what you should go with.

Every single album in my collection of musicals, barbershop, country, 30s, soundtracks, classical, old rock, new rock, new age, pretty much everything but rap, sounds better in every way than it ever has before. Rap probably does too, I just hate it, so I haven't tested that.\n\nThe only thing that doesn't thrill me about this set is that you can't turn off the subwoofer. With a subwoofer this big, you really should have the option to turn it off, 'cause even with the bass all the way down, it can still make your headache pound. Otherwise, I find that about 11 o'clock on the control is perfect for background listening, 1 o'clock is perfect for focused listening, and sometimes you just gotta turn it all the way up. But really, with that super handy control, you can make any music sound just right.\n\nOh yeah, you also see these compared all over the net to Klipsch's 2.1 THX cert set.  I'm not sure why.

I have mounted this system and spread the speaker and the Woofer box and the remote contol to the distances that I desired, and the sound is Fantastic!\n\nFor the speakers, all you need to do is buy the rca extension cables  (that have a male on one end and a female rca plug on the other end, the cheap ones work fine). They can be ordered in 6', 10', or even 25Ft lengths.  These are used to extend the satellite speakers AND the inputs, ie DVD player, Tv, etc. to reach the large woofer box.\n\nThe secret to extending the remote control is.... You must use an old type.. VGA monitor 15 pin cable... like our old computer monitors came with..it must have a male on one end and a female 15 pin connector on the other end. OR if you can only find the male to male extension cable, then get a gender changer to change one of the ends to female.  THE TRICK FOR THIS CABLE IS ... when you are shopping for this vga extension cable.. MAKE SURE.. it has 15 pins! many of these cables are missing one pin (they only have 14 pins). AND You can see this in the picture online if you look at the cable end, in the online pictures of this cable. Both types of cables can be found and ordered here at Amazon.  Just search for a vga or svga 15 pin extension cable...and count the pins on the male end.  You can get different lengths to suit your purpose.  since I could not add a link above. Amazons link adder would not work for me.\n\n go to SF cable and search for this product:\n \"HD15 SVGA Monitor Extension Cable, Male to Female with Ferrite Bead\"\n by SFCable DONT FORGET TO COUNT THE PINS !

(I was also able to hide my wires with some imagination) and there is NO noticeable difference in performance with them extended far from each other.  In fact, the sound is much improved by spreading the sounds out!\n\nAs for mounting the two small speakers.. If you pull the grill/cover off the front of the speaker, then with your finger nail, remove the 4 rubber plugs that hold the grill/cover to the speaker then you can remove the 4 (hidden) phillips head screws that hold the speaker half together.  Then I drilled two small holes in the back half..and used the holes I made, to securely fasten them to the wall!

Some folks have commented on the lack of mid-range provided by the satellites.  I didn't feel there was anything noticeably lacking in that area when I first hooked up the system, but since I had a pair of JBL E10 bookshelf speakers laying around, I wired them in tandem with the Z-2300 satellites.  I have to admit, this created a really nice balance, and a fuller, richer sound compared to the Z-2300's satellites alone.\n\nRadioShack had everything I needed to accomplish this (2 RCA Y splitters [Model: 42-2536],  and 2 RCA-to-tinned wire extensions [Model: 42-2371]).

I've owned a couple different brands, but wasn't satisfied with their performance.\n\nI read a lot of online reviews, and these came up as the best over and over again. CNET's review of these sealed the deal, and I bought them. I've owned these for 4 days, and all I can say is WOW.\n\nThese are absolutey the best PC speakers I've ever heard, and I've heard a lot of them. I'm sort of an audiophile, so I appreciate good-sounding, quality speakers and audio equipment, and I am very satisfied with Logitech's Z-2300's. If you are considering a speaker system for your PC (you can also hook these to other devices like a X-Box, Playstation, television, DVD player, MP3 player with the included adaptors), look no further. They might be expensive, but for the money you cannot find a better system. Klipsch's new ProMedia system is the closest competitor to these, but I do not think it's better, plus it's more expensive, costing about $200 and up. Bose has nice ones, but you'll pay $300+ for them.\n\nThese are not your garden-variety computer speakers, but premium, high-end units that in my opinion, are unrivaled in terms of all-around sound quality. These are so good, that they've attained the holy-grail of sound systems, the THX-certification seal. This is an award not handed out often; not many speaker systems, top-end or low-end, attain this rating. It sets the benchmark for sound quality and speaker performance. How Logitech managed to get it with a speaker set costing under $200 is beyond me, but they have.\n\nThey include features found on systems costing hundreds more (think Bose, Harmon Kardon, Klipsch, Creative Labs) like 400-watts of RMS power, a 200 watt, 8-inch long-throw pressure driver subwoofer (award-winning design touted as one of the best), and polished aluminum one-piece phase-plugs for the satellite drivers (for superior frequency-response and sound quality as opposed to two-piece designs). You also get a nifty remote control with a master volume control, 3.5mm headphone jack, and a dial to adjust the bass level. I love the remote. It's nice to not have to get up to adjust the speaker volume on the speaker itself. I can use the remote. It has a 6 foot long cable for the subwoofer COM and audio in plug so you can stretch it pretty far. Logitech includes an audio adapter that lets you connect the speakers to a game console using the 2 white/red audio connectors from the composite connector.\n\nIf you've owned the average speaker systems, get ready for a surprise the moment you listen to these. I could immediately tell a difference. My music 'came alive.' Higher frequencies were chrisper, more defined, and clearer, and more pronounced. Frequencies that I couldn't get with my old speakers came through loud and clear (like guitar riffs, cymbal taps, synthesizers and keyboards, violins, tympani drums, pianos, and flutes), and the lower-frequencies also became more pronounced and defined. They sound very close, if not better than my high-end Yamaha 5.1 home theater system, which has awesome sound, for 1/5 the price, and 1/4 of the size. It's truly amazing how Logitech got this much sound and sound quality out of a 2.1 system!\n\nA bit of a warning: To say that these are loud is sort of an understatement; they are really loud! It's pretty much pointless to turn the volume up past 60%. The subwoofer is very powerful and gives gives ground-shaking a new meaning when compared to other systems. Either way, if you are an apartment or duplex-dweller, I cannot think of a faster or easier way to annoy your neighbors without talking to them! In movies, explosions, punches, crashes, and gunfire are amazing. In games, explosions shake the ground.\n\nMy only gripes are questionable build quality and the hardwired satellite speakers (they include leads with 5 foot cords ending in RCA jacks which plug into the subwoofer. Why Logitech chose this is a mystery; It wouldn't be hard to put jacks for wires in these speakers and would probably cut down on the price. Higher-end systems have this feature, and allows the use of different-length or higher quality speaker wires.\n\nMy system came refurbished, but one of the RCA jacks was blown, so the left channel was dead, despite it being tested before shipping it out. It also acted strange when I first set it up- the volume was very low despite turning it up to 100%, the computer to 100%, and my media player to 100%. It eventually sorted itself out though, and despite just one speaker working, the sound is still excellent. I got an RMA on it and the new unit worked perfectly.\n\nLogitech includes a 2-year warranty, and it's a good thing. Other owners I talked to had similar problems, with channels going dead, speakers dying, and subwoofers/amplifiers dying on them after 6 months to a 2 years.\n\nMy suggestion is to buy an extended warranty from SquareTrade or another provider (I did, it cost me $10 for 2 years).\n\nOcerall, an unrivaled set of speakers for the price. Provided your system doesn't crap out on you after the warranty expires, it won't disapoint. Awesome sound at a fantastic value, what's not to like about that?\n\n6 YEAR UPDATE!\n\nIt's been 6 years since I bought these, so this is a long-term update. I am very happy to report that the speakers haven't skipped a beat. They work perfect and haven't given me any of the problems that other users have mentioned. No dead RCA's, crackling, overheating, nothing. I still get the great sound that rivals my friend's $2,000 Bose 2.1 system. They have held up great. My wife's cat chewed through the audio input cable that plugs into the computer/media player, but I was able to repair it. I thought I'd have to  spend $60+ on a new remote because it's a weird 3-in-one cable, 2 positive/negative tiny 26 gauge conductors with a copper stranded conductor surrounding them. It makes repairing it difficult, but not impossible. Took me over an hour to strip and solder them up satisfactorily. No problems since.\n\nIf you can find them, I still recommend them. No more 4-stars. I am happy to give them 5! This is still the best 2.1 speaker system out there even after almost 10 years. Nobody has created a system that does all the Z-2300's can do.

The subwoofer does not hum, which was a problem with my previous 2.1 configuration. The sound is more than acceptable. Others complained about a lack of midrange. I disagree. You may have to do some tweaking with your audio player to get the sound you like, but I found that I didn't need to.\n\nPlay a movie, and it's just like being in the theater. I have RARELY had the volume above halfway, which is more than enough to rattle walls. The wired remote sits neatly on my desk next to my keyboard, and is no bother. I like being able to plug my headphones into the remote, instead of having to plug in to the side of the speakers with my old set. If you're listening to the speakers and have to kill the sound because you thought you heard the phone ringing, the handy button on the remote does the trick. I thought that having a wired remote would be a huge pain, but for me, it's not at all.\n\nTHX speakers really give a great sound, whether watching a movie, or listening to classical, rock, or jazz.

I will keep everything as I originally wrote it except for this paragraph. I have to reduce my rating down to one star because of a simple quality problem. Suddenly the speakers started a loud buzzing noise. To make sure it wasn't my computer I plugged it in to different sources. I found that the flaw is in the 2.5mm (or is it 3.5mm?) connector. It is so skinny and poorly made that it became faulty and is the reason for the noise. When I move it around a little bit it will stop buzzing here and there but how could Logitech skimp on quality on such an important connector? At least they could have made it detachable so I could easily replace it without getting a whole new volume control unit. I'm not going through the trouble and time to get a new unit sent to me from Logitech so I'm going to have to buy a new box and switch this volume controller with the new one and return the defective piece of garbage to the store! It's the quickest way I can figure to get this working again. Logitech really dropped the ball on this one. My venting is over so here was my original review...\n\n After hearing the Bose Companion 3's at my local BJ's Wholesale club I decided it was time for me to upgrade my computer's speakers. I went home and researched my different options out there and it came between the Bose and the Logitech Z-2300. So I bought them both and first hooked up the Logitech. I used it for one week and I was highly impressed with the gaming sound performance and the ability to adjust the bass with the desktop volume controller. I wasn't thrilled with the music and I spent lots of time adjusting the EQ. After nothing worked I found out I had my sound cards setting on gaming mode. So I turned it to Entertainment/Music mode and things were better but still not blow me out of my seat better.\n\n  Now it was time to set up the Bose Companion 3's and compare the difference. The Bose equipment was much smaller and overall more attractive. The Bose's subwoofer fit under my desk while the Logitech's sub has to go on the side of my desk because of it's large size. If it wasn't for the Logitech's lack of an auxillary input and it's attractiveness deficiencies I would never of even unpacked the Bose. Yet I really wanted an auxillary input and a more attractive setup. So I set up the Bose and it looked great but I knew at that size it would not be able to put out nearly the same amount of volume as the Z-2300. I was right.\n\n  I rarely ever got over 50% volume on the Logitech but with the Bose I had the volume maxed out on certain songs. At first I thought the Bose was better on music and then when I switched to games I knew right away the Bose wasn't even close. I had to go to the back of the sub to adjust the bass because the gunfire was much to loud and sharp. No fingertip bass control for the Bose. So now I have to choose between music and gaming I think to myself. So now I go back to music to see \"how much better\" the Bose is to the Logitech.\n\n  I used a control of about ten songs in back to back comparisons. I played one on the Bose and then on the Z-2300's. I found that the Logitech was also far superior in music playback as well. It had a much fuller, cleaner, and more realistic sound than the Bose. The Z-2300's far outperformed the Bose in all the songs compared except for one. Alan Parson's Project \"Eye in the Sky\" was the only one that may of sounded slightly better on the Bose. Playing hard rock on the Bose was like a bad joke. I played Finger Eleven's \"Complicated Questions\" and it sounded horrible on the Bose in comparison to the Z-2300's.\n\n As many have said about the Companion 3's tiny satellite speakers, they just cannot produce a strong, full mid-range. There is simply a lot missing from most types of music with the Bose. Best bang for the buck is by far the Z-2300's. If Logitech would have put an auxillary input on their volume controller like Bose did I would have given this system five stars for sure. Also I am not sure why they made the speakers non-adjustable, upward firing speakers. The speakers are actually pointing over my head since my desk has elevated speaker stands but I still notice great sound quality. Even if the Z-2300's were the same price as the Bose I would have easily chosen these Logitech's. If the Bose were half the price of these Z-2300's than I might have taken the performance hit and have gone with the Bose because of the decent sound, small size, and good looks."}, "316": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 4.0, "text": "people say this speaker system misses some frequency, yes it is weak in some part, but if you adjust your equalizer in your itunes, you will be fine. great speakers"}, "317": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "This system is excellent.

You'll eliminate a large majority of the market  (the mediocre performers you wouldn't be happy with anyway) and make your decision process easier.  All speakers I reference below are THX certified.\n\nI purchased this Logitech for the laptop in my bedroom and have compared it to its competitor, a 200 watt 2.1 Klipsch from 2008 and three of its big brothers in the Logitech family,  the 400 watt Z-560 from 2001, the 280 watt Z-5300 from 2005 and the 505 watt Z-5500 from 2010.\n\nMy 1st THX certified speakers, the 400 watt Logitech Z-560 4.1 is over 10 years old and continues to be my primary system as of this review - you can read my 5 star review on them. In 2005 I purchased the 280 watt Z-5300 5.1 surround sound for my sister and she still thanks me for them today.  Then in 2008 I bought a 200 watt Klipsch 2.1 system for a friend who had no music and no working speakers. I was introducing her to my music and wanted to pair it with quality sounding speakers. Much of my music has deep bass so I look for speakers to handle the lows equally as well as they can handle the highs. Knowing the reputation of the Klipsch name I wanted to give them a try but they came up short on the bass end. They distorted at volumes that the Logitech's thumped right through. At volumes that I feel a subwoofer should handle.\n\nMy most recent purchase, the Logitech Z-2300, is for use with my laptop in the master bedroom and wow! It gets 5 stars. I use it for movie watching and music listening - finding myself retiring to the room much earlier each evening not to sleep but to enjoy movies or music in the comfort of bed.\n\nIn all my systems, I use MusicMatch Jukebox player with DFX plugin for the equalizer.  For those of you asking about the mid range on these speakers, you're absolutely right they come up short. With the equalizer though, the results are stunning.\n\nUPDATE 2010; No thanks to Yahoo, I was forced to retire the now defunct MusicMatch Jukebox and replaced it with MediaMonkey and another DFX plugin. All speaker systems from 2001 to date are still performing well except the Z-5300 which started blowing fuses last month. It was already 5 yrs old and out of warranty but Logitech offered me 50% off any system of my choice as replacement. I was pleasantly shocked since I was only asking if I was using the correct fuse.

I liked its sound while playing streaming audio files (56 Kb) - internet radio, youtube, e.t.c. For compressed files Logitech with wider musical spectrum seems (or sounds) to be a better choice than more directional Klipsh. I did have hard time deciding between the two while playing DVDs. Klipsh offers more detailed and clearer sound but seems less dimensional than Logitech. With Klipsh the dialog seemed to be coming from the bottom of the screen, where Logitech more accurately matched the picture.\nThe thing that won me over to keep the almost twice expensive (must include extended warranty due to its notorious subwoofer problems) Klipsh was its unbeatable dominance with quality music. Logitech with its rather poor midrange was no competition. Playing CDs with Klipsh was a pure joy. The sound is very clear and warm, especially the vocals that sounded quite bland with Logitech just shined on Klipsh.\nSo the final conclusion. I don't think it's right to say one is better than the other - both carry exceptional value and leave its competition in the dust.

(I, frankly, didn't expect them to actually work without the sub woofer."}, "403": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 4.0, "text": "Hello folks,\n\nA quick overview instead of a epic essay.\nFor the money you are paying for this, remember this is not a high-end system but a system to replace dinky speakers so you can hear more bass then mids.\nPRO's: it's a great system to use for gaming or movies. Place them far apart from one another you can actually produce imaging. The sound clarity are great as the 2 full range satellites produce crisp highs.  The sub-woofer can handle anything you blast through it from playing Drum & Bass to Classical music.\n\nCON's: if you max out the volume the sub becomes muddy and at times will start popping. For Classical music it can handle the thunder of drums and the highs of a violin but if you are playing Drum & Bass or anything with deep bass the sup will start gradually popping.  If you play music at a continues high volumes eventually the satellites will blow out.\n\nSUGGESTIONS: Add a pair of Polk Audio T15 series [5 1/4\" woofer with a 1\" soft dome tweeter @ rating at 100 watts max & 50RMS] and the entire listening environment experience changes. You can define the clarity's of the mid's to high's as anything you play through them becomes a beautiful experience. I play a variety of music but mostly Drum & Bass, if you buy a good pair of shelve speakers and incorporate it with the sub you can play continues loud music for a long time without blowing as the music is clear and crisp. Just keep mind to keep the sub-woofer free from clutter and this system will rock without the amp overheating.\n\nhoped this helped yea."}, "404": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 4.0, "text": "I am by far not an audiophile but I have some pretty top class noise cancellation headphones and taking them off to listen to these doesn't annoy me.  They sound really good in every application I have put them to.  Even with a Auzentech Prelude(x-fi chip) in game mode, the 3d sound reproduction can't come close to headphones or a good 5.1, 7.1 set but its really good enough for a set of 2.1 speakers.\n\nIf your a gamer, and like listening to music I really couldn't recommend any other speakers.  For $100 you get a really nice system, well worth the cash.  I don't have to be an audiophile to know that you can get way better, but with that \"way better\" comes alot of cash.\n\nIf you wan't to invest a little more in your speakers though and forego the subwoofer I would suggest M-Audio's AV40.  You can always buy a good woofer down the line to connect them to~  For everyone else that likes it simple, cheap and good go Logitech.

They offer great frequency response, crisp sound, and a decent design, all at a bargain price.\n\nPros: Strong bass, but not overpowering. The wired remote makes precise control easy; the wheel spins with the perfect amount of resistance. The wired remote controls the speaker volume, sub volume, and includes a power switch (which turns off the bright blue LED light) and headphone jack. The speakers are built solidly, and look nice; a lot of speakers are too gawdy.\n\nCons: Mid-range is decent, highs are decent, but the middle-low range is lacking. The bass is strong, but the non-adjustable crossover frequency is set too low. The effect is strong bass up to about 90-100Hz, but the speakers don't come on strong until about 150Hz, leaving a noticeable \"gap\". (I don't know the exact frequencies; I'm estimating). An example of this in music is strong bass guitar and drums, but the voices will sound ever so slightly hollow because the bass range of the human voice falls in that \"gap\". It's not a big deal, just something that makes them inferior to higher-end alternatives.\n\nVerdict: Excellent value alternative to higher-end options like Klipsch or Bose.

The control center of it all, the remote thing (nontechnical term i guess) sits on your desk.  It also plugs into the back of the sub and has another cable coming from it that runs into whatever you want to listen to (i.e. laptop, ipod, etc.) Yes, these work with your ipod, although they need power so they aren't too portable, but it's still cool.\n\nSo what makes these the ones you want to buy?\nFor a 10\" subwoofer, the price of this thing isn't bad at all.

I'd like to offer a review somewhat different than what you've read before.  It's a long one so if you're looking for something quick, you may want to stop here.  Otherwise hopefully you'll enjoy the perspective.  My thanks go out to those who let us know who you are and what you do in your review, and how you use the system, it really makes a difference.  It's important to know the story behind why someone is buying something and what they are looking to do, otherwise you get mismatched needs and solutions.  My story begins during the first month of 2008, when I got myself  into a bit of a speaker craze while searching for a sound solution for every room of my house.  Three years ago I put my life's music collection in digital format on iTunes to the tune of over 5000 songs with perhaps the widest array of music than anyone else I know: Jazz, Hip-hop, R&B, trip hop, electronica, techno, country, audio books, Tony Robbins, metal, rock, dub, enigma type stuff, lounge, new-aje, world music, caribbean, Latin and on the list goes.  So, when I say I've tested these speakers over a wide variety of music, you can take my word for it.\n\nMy demographic: Male, business owner (custom Italian leather journals, guest books and photo albums: see epica . com ) and hip-hop dancer choreographer, 30 years old, Southern California.  Creative, very into pleasing the senses.\n\nAfter growing up with stereo systems that catered to more bass than clarity, my initial goal was to discover what would be the most clear, best, space filling rich sound I could in each room of the house while still being incredibly aesthetically pleasing and unobtrusive at the best price.  I wanted to turn up the volume and be amazed at what I heard without any distortion and I wanted to be thrilled at the lowest volumes as well. I wanted to feel like I was there, to have a music experience every time I turned something on.  The best price part went out the door rather quickly.\n\nSo here's what I did:  Apple sells a device called an Airport Express that among other things such as being a wireless router, also allows you to stream iTunes music to it wirelessly.  All you have to do is plug in a stereo mini plug to one end and an audio source to another.  Give it a name like living room and it appears in iTunes. you can have several of these devices all over the house.  In the past I have always hooked up big stereos or shelf systems to it for sound but now in the age of tiny computer speakers and iPod doc systems, I've realized you can connect anything to it and have taken the experience to a whole new level.  There are now 4 airport expresses in the house in different rooms along with an apple TV which also features this Airtunes feature in the living room,  bedroom, second bedroom, kitchen and hallway... yes the hallway.\n\nAfter having spent hours in the Apple Store and Best Buy listening to different sound docks and speakers with my iPhone and collection of music, I just decided to purchase and used every single unit that caught my interest with the decision that those which didn't give me everything I was looking for, I'd just return. (The manufacturers must love me.)  Because what can you really tell about a speaker or sound system in a 30,000 foot warehouse with sound and people all around you?  Are you kidding? Nothing. You've really got to setup these systems in your environment.\n\nIt's also important that you test your purchase in different places and positions all throughout your house. You won't believe the difference in sound from having  say, a SounDock in your bathroom vs. a bedroom.  Move the subwoofer around, adjust the bass on it, move the speakers, be creative. you'll surprise yourself.\n\nFinally, a word about Bose.  Of all the sound companies that I read reviews for, and I read about 400 before making a purchase, I have never seen such a contrasting fan base.  You've got people who detest anything Bose and people who would buy it without listening to anything else. For the record I am neither of these people.  I have owned Bose products in the past and enjoyed them as I have with other companies but was not biased towards or against them prior to purchase.\n\nThe Systems:\n\nThe Klipsch Prop-Media 2.1 speakers were my purchase. I was attracted to what I knew about the Brand, the subwoofer control on the actual satellite speaker and the $150 price point.  I got them home and aesthetically I was just never really attracted to the speaker.  My place has a very Asian-Zen and modern feel and these just kind of stood out in the wrong way wherever I placed them.  But we're talking about sound so I looked past that. It's got a pretty large subwoofer, and the satellites where small enough to go anywhere. Klipsch does a great job with their horn tweeters and it really let's the highs soar.  I tried them in my home office and bedroom for a week before I returned them.  Why?\nI loved that they were THX, which means there was no hissing whatsoever and they were dead quiet when music was shut off.  I was also pleased and could not  believe the power. These speakers have so much gain and get so loud, that I don't think full volume would even be tolerable to the human ear. But that was the thing. They seemed to distort at the higher volumes I tend to enjoy and didn't seem to fill a room at low volumes. The subwoofer is recommended to be set at 8 o'clock (very low) and if you adjust that any higher the bass is quite over powering.  The sound coming from the Klipsch speakers was not a bad or poor sound, it was great, it was ridiculously powerful but it just wasn't the best sound I had heard for music. They ultimately went back to the store,  and I give them a 4 star rating, but I'd be open to trying them in again in a different setting.  I think I found them to be to cumbersome as well.\n\nTo their credit, RoomGroove wireless for $300, is their latest version of what I am doing with the airport express where you can link multiple room grooves up and they'll wireless send sound to each other. Points to them for finally getting something like this on the market.\n\nLogitech Z-2300 THX: WOW.  I was a little biased at first because I thought, Logitech? Really? The people who shine at making wireless mice and keyboards? How can they compare to these other big sound companies? What can they possibly bring to the table?  Five stars no question. Here I had nothing to go on other than the $150 price point. I brought them home and unpacked. Ok, the subwoofer with this speaker set is not for the faint of heart. It is absolutely enormous and well suited for a larger office or larger room.  It's got two attractive enough (without the grills) aluminum speakers, and a similar wired remote to the Bose only this has the subwoofer control on it (fortunately) and a headphone jack. (no external auxiliary mini plug)\n\nWhere to begin. This system has started off in and remains to this day in my office.  At low volumes it is rich, deep, clear, and not overpowering in any respect. The music soars no matter what you're listening to.  It's an absolute pleasure to sit before these speakers and  I should start leaving them playing some sort of music more often because it really really sounds tremendous.  And that's only the beginning.\n\nOnce the staff goes home and I can crank these up, every wall in the building shakes.  The other bathrooms sound as though there is an earthquake and we should evacuate the building. I know it sounds like I'm a big bass person but this is the least of my desires. The clarity, much like the companion 5's just keeps getting richer and richer as you turn the volume up. Artist's vocals scream out at you and this system is the loudest of any I have heard. Interestingly it's also the most tolerable at high volume that I have heard as well.\n\nI love the fact that it's got RCA jacks for speaker cables which allow you to easily extend them if you want them more than a few inches apart or want to place the subwoofer farther away than right at your feet.  I love the power and clarity of these speakers, I love that the remote has the bass on the module and you don't have to adjust it behind the subwoofer.  Five golden stars are easily awarded. Go Logitech.\n\nAltec Lansing T-612 and Bose SounDock Portable:\nHaving tested the Harmon Kardon Sound Sticks, JBL On Stage, Klipsch iGroove, the Zeppelin monster, iHome, logitech pure fi and many others, these are the two I wound up bringing home.\n\nTechnology is great. We give birth to new ideas which create new ways we listen to music like iPods and iTunes, and that stimulates thought to a new level and we create devices made especially just for these things like the wide array of docking stations, something we had no need for in the past, and then we give birth to new ideas again and say wouldn't it be great to have our music collection on our phone and eliminate devices, and that get's created, and one company wins out over all the others and soon that creates a new problem: cell phone interference and shielding and that gives birth to the first of a new line of products: the iPhone safe Altec T-612.  The first docking station to not be affected by sound interference from cell phones.\n\nIt worked well. I give it 5 stars for innovation, sound, it's own bass and treble controls on the unit that can be controlled by the remote control, size and a pretty unique look. (Which I am personally not attracted to) This purchase lasted 24 hours before it was returned. It was going to be used as a hallway speaker and so probably would not get much use out of the iPod Dock.  It goes for $200 which seems reasonable.  Ultimately though it did not have the fullness and richness, or spaciousness that the Bose did, and the bass cracked on several songs.  This is perfect for a teen, or college person or someone who just listens to music here and threre at reasonable volumes in the kitchen or around the house.\n\nBose SounDock Portable.  FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS, and no sale or special pricing. Certainly you have to have a unique perspective on money to purchase one of these for yourself.  One now resides in my bedroom and another in the hallway so certainly I'll share mine.  Are there alternatives on the market that you will be happy with? Absolutely.  $400 is a lot of money to spend on a device like this. Or is it?  I sell a $10,000 journal on the Epica website,  I have seen $12,000 pens, $400,000 automobiles, $200 for torn up jeans (and that's just a normal brand), $12 to see a movie, $50 for a tank of gas, $4000 for a high end washer and dryer... look at the world we live in.  Certainly dollar for dollar you are not paying for the product itself or the metal, cotton or components, EVER, but the value it brings to you. The features and luxuries and benefits it brings.  The feeling. And that always has a price.\n\nHow many times have you shopped for the best deal on something, bought it, and then later wished you had purchased the better version, or gotten the special optional features, or wish you had just splurged after the fact. How many times have you not been able to do it like when you purchase a car? I have just gotten myself used to two things. One: happiness comes from your thoughts and your ability to keep your mind and focus on things that please you, not from objects you buy, and two, the fact that if contrast has caused me to give birth to a desire for wanting something, and I think in the obtaining of it I will be more pleased in owning it than the less expensive version,  I am going to buy the one that brings me the most pleasure and gives me personally, the best feeling.\n\nNeed, purpose, design, size and functionality all coalesced with the SounDock and so I spent 200 more dollars after I returned the Lansing for something that would be kept in my hallway which pointed into the bathroom.  But it was more discreet, it had a revolving iPod dock that I could hide from view when not using it, a remote control that let me change my playlists (that most remotes do not do), a look that was much more attractive and streamline, and a sound that was just richer and fuller.\n\nAnd while it pains me immensely to know that I took the two-hundred heart pounding watts of Klipsch out of my bedroom, the amazing, clear, spacious and dynamic sound of the Bose Companion 3s out of my bedroom and now have replaced those with another SounDock, portable, it certainly does create magic in the bedroom.  Aside from two lamps, it is the ONLY other wire in the room. It's small, and doubles as my alarm clock. I LOVE the  fact that I can wake up to any song or play list in the world.  using an iPod  (I am very put off by Apple's decision to not have a snooze button on iPod alarm, while it is on the iPhone, however on the iPhone you can only wake up to a ringtone! Silly)  I love how it fills a room and how if you're not in the room you hear it loud and clear and would have no idea something so small is producing all that sound.\n\nI have really come to appreciate Bose. They create the best sound they can possibly engineer by pouring 100% of their profits back into research and deliver the best product they can that generally takes years to release. They think their sound sounds best flat, with no adjustment. That's what the EQ is for on the iPod or iTunes or whatever source you're using. They realize you shouldn't have to tweak all the treble and bass if the sound is just amazing to begin with.  It's all about the feeling you get when you listen to it.  The SounDock does not sound as good as a system like the Companion  3's or any other subwoofer driven device but you have to look at it's purpose and size.\n\nSounDock gets five stars for listening to customer requests and making their successful SounDock portable even better by adding the aux in port so I can hear music wirelessly, a great remote with lots of functionality, discreet touch volume buttons,  a hideaway revolving dock door to make it look even cleaner than it already does, a great room filling sound, a battery that lasts, a slimmer design, a power cord that wraps around the transformer and an overall sound that makes you feel very good when listening to it.  Try placing one of these things in your kitchen, hall, bathroom, closet or smaller room and listen to the rumble and sound. Amazing.\n\nBose Companion 3's: When I first set these up in my office I was absolutely amazed by the quality and quantity of sound coming out of these speakers.  They are gorgeous, discrete and fit the bill for big sound.  I was impressed by the fact that I could turn them up to full volume, with any kind of music and here no distortion of any kind. That one fact is so rare, that made them a winner for me right there.  When listening to Diana Krall, I felt as though her lips where inches from my ear as she sang only to me.  These speakers really sing out.\nFor some reason when I tried watching movies on them, the volume decreased significantly and so even at full blast the sound was not that loud. Over time these speakers have moved from office to bedroom to ultimately being returned to the store but not  because I was dissatisfied. I kept these things in my closet for 3 weeks because I didn't want to return them, I wanted to find a use for them or somewhere to enjoy them.  They went back because I didn't want 5 cords in my bedroom and a subwoofer at the foot of my bed.\n\nLike the companion 5's, I like the puck volume control  (would be nice if it was wireless, wouldn't it? Especially if everything else on your desk is).  It's very sensitive and feels good to touch. One gentle tap and sound is muted, another and it comes back on.  It's also nice to be able to increase or decrease the bass that pours out of these units on the back of the subwoofer by virtually a full 360 degrees.  I am also pleased with the RCA jacks used to connect each speaker. Initially I was put off and wondered why they did it but when I realized how EFFORTLESS (one of my favorite words) it was to extend the speaker cable, i.e.  just plug in another video cable, I was thrilled.  Five stars to the Companion 3s\n\nBose Companion 5's: It's funny how when you don't know what you're missing, you don't miss it.  I tell people that in my business that when you buy this $185 journal and you haven't seen the $265 version, you think you're in heaven. It's perfection.  Then you see the top of the line and you just can't imagine it gets any better. The Companion 5's are nearly triple the size of the Companion 3's (Yet still rather small and attractive), look absolutely gorgeous next to my iMac, have the same puck with mute, headphones, volume up and down and auxiliary input just like the Companion 3's (which will play something at simultaneously as what you have going on your computer).\n\nBUT there are two major differences in these speakers vs anything else I have heard, ever. One is it connects to your USB port, not your stereo mini plug in port which requires 2 minutes of configuring, and two, the sound that comes out of these speakers is the most delicious, exquisite, full, wide, spacious, rich, detailed sound I have EVER heard come out of speakers in this class.  Anyone I have shared them with leaves with their jaw on the floor. As I turn up the volume we just stare at the computer and say WOW.  It just sucks you in. Where  before I did not enjoy spending time in front of the computer for very long, I can literally spend hours in front of this one or in the room where the Companion 5's are playing. The sound is that unbelievable.  The cables as of this writing are proprietary and cannot be extended, however for the `surround effect' it's not recommended that you extend them anyway.\n\nI enjoy barely audible volume levels in the morning but come nighttime, I love to crank up the sound and  speakers can take it at a volume so loud you can only take it for a short period. It's as though with each increment you raise the volume, you experience a new dimension to sound.  The Bose Companion 5's for this purpose get 5 stars, 10 if I could, for looks, size and for a sound like no other.\n\nFinally, don't be led astray by the Bose advertising. These speakers are marketed towards people who like to watch movies in front of their computer, something that, after spending all day in front of a computer, is the last thing I want to do.  I've tried it and yes it's a great experience but if you never watch a video clip with these speakers it will still be the  best investment you make for music and any other sound that comes out of them.  The Bose experts will also tell you that these speakers should not be more than 24 inches apart because they are specifically engineered for you to sit right in front of them. When I heard that I also thought the sound quality would decrease if I stepped away, or perhaps it wouldn't fill a room the way I want.  Not the case. Inches away or across the room, I cannot say enough about this virtual surround sound speaker.\n\nSo hopefully that gives you a little more insight into what these speakers can do for you, how they can be used, what I was looking for in particular and what the actual experience was.  If you made it this far, your a trooper.  I hope you found the review useful and if you wanted to contact me with questions we actually sell on the Amazon site.  Just do a search for Epica journal and you can write in.

For my taste, the Logitech Z-2300 speaker system outperforms all current Bose computer speakers, Bang & Olufsen's ridiculously overprized Beolab 4 and every other speaker set I listened to in many stores over the past weeks. They produce a nice, rich sound across the entire frequency spectrum even at low volumes (at very low volumes the remote bass volume adjustment may come handy but is not necessary to get good sound). In particular when using them as computer speakers (what they actually are) sitting in front of the computer, I do not have problems with the midrange (but did with the Bose speakers). The satellites are a little large but this provides the benefit of larger diameter mid tone speakers, warranting better midtone performance than the Bose speakers, for example. The high wattage pays off not only when playing the music loud, but also when listening to low volume music, which is what I like most. The power of the system allows even weak signals to drive the speakers well, resulting in good low volume performance. All in all, these speakers deliver excellent sound comparable to much more expensive Stereo/HiFi systems for a very reasonable price. They definitely are the best 2.1 computer speaker system I have found for the demanding listener who does not just want loud noise, but rather a good, rich music experience. They are appropriately priced (less than half of the Companion 3 and ~20% of the Beolab 4) and come with 2 years warranty for some nice peace of mind. I tested them with rock, pop, blues, jazz, folk and classical music and they performed well for all of these genres. Definitely a 5-star system (unless it'll break down soon). Only criticism: The remote cable is very thick and the remote a bit too light, so it easily slides on the desk. This is a low price to pay for great speakers, though - as those are really hard to find these days, since manufacturers appear to focus on increasing Surround channel numbers rather than improving sound quality. The Z-2300 system fills this gap very well."}, "538": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "It's probably impossible to beat these speakers for the price/performance ratio.

The 200 watt system is plenty for the room which is about 35x60 ft. I can turn it up so that the volume is plenty loud (even too loud), up close on the dance floor and about right for the rest of the room, all with no distortion. I ended up mounting the lightweight satellite speakers on a couple of aluminum camera tripods and it is all very light and portable (except for the subwoofer, which isn't too bad to carry around). As some have mentioned, the speakers are a little lacking on the extreme high end, but not bad for live sound. Also mentioned were the short speaker wires. No worry, go to Radio Shack and get a 10ft RCA speaker wire extension and you're set. People are amazed at the sound from these little speakers because they are used to seeing larger, back-breaking speaker boxes that don't even sound as good!

For under a hundred dollars, you get a decent three way setup.  Some other reviewers have complained of a lack of mid-range, but mid-range is for vocals, and I tend to listen to a lot of instrumentals (Jeff Beck and Eric Johnson come to mind) and though well intentioned, a lack of focus on mid-range doesn't dispell the idea that these speakers are as good a deal as you will find for under a hundred bucks.  As I mentioned, the Edirols we have are rated at somewhere around 8 to 10 watts RMS per channel.  I think, if I remember correctly, these Logitechs are about 25 watts per channel and there is no muddying the bass until you turn them well past the point where the Edirols are screeching and belching.

The z2300s, however aren't far behind on the highs, and they completely dominate on the lows thanks to the sub.  Though the Logitechs may be a little heavy on the bass for some, your computer/media programs should have built in equalizers that can fix that issue.\n\nThe z2300s can go very loud without losing overall clarity. The wired remote is nice, and in my opinion I have enough wireless remotes so it's no problem that I have to be near the computer to change the volume (my comp has a remote anyway).  They also match my Samsung 226cw monitor and Logitech DiNovo edge keyboard near perfectly and seem much more solidly constructed than the Klipsh.  And for all the complaints of the speakers lacking in the mid range, if you do you're homework you'll find that all computers tend to suffer that issue (compression and encoding are the main culprits). You can pretty much always get a higher fidelity sound out of a home audio system that plays CDs or DVDs.  So as far as computer speakers go; for the price, these speakers are awesome.\n\nAlso, I'm currently using the 15 day trial version of the SRS WOW sandbox  program, which definitely improves overall quality and clarity throughout the sound-range.

Everything else sounds good when you're close enough to the speakers, but as you move away it gets pretty weak.  For the living room you definitely need a 2.1 system.  Even the  M-Audio StudioPro 3 Desktop Audio Monitors, which seem the be the best of the 2 speaker systems couldn't handle a real room.  As mentioned in a number of other reviews, the subwoofer unit is larger than others out there.  I expect that's part of the reason these have good power.  Make sure you've got a good place to hide it.  Sound is very good comparatively.  Nothing is going to sound like a real 200w component stereo, but this comes pretty close.  I find that the imaging, or perceptual soundstage is a little lacking, not as clearly defined as with the JBL Creature II 3-Piece Powered Speaker System or the M-Audio Studio 3.  This got better when I added 6' RCA cable extenders to the satellite speaker wires which allowed me to separate the satellites a bit.  But still not great.  The volume knob thing is nice, and it's nice to have both volume and bass adjustment handy.  I guess you could have easily put the controls on one of the satellites like everyone else though.  The headphone jack on the volume control seems pointless to me, but maybe you'll like it.  What I wish was that you could have an aux input on the volume thing to plug in your ipod or something else.\n\nOffice -  JBL Creature II 3-Piece Powered Speaker System\nThese 2.1 speakers don't have the total power of the Logitech Z-2300, but they have much clearer and better imaging.  Since my office is smaller than my living room, and shares a wall with someone, I don't need as much power.  These were perfect.  The high end is crisp, and the subwoofer clean.  The volume control on the satellites is handy, but the bass adjustment is on the subwoofer.  I thought this would be an issue, but you actually kind of set it and monkey with it a bit in the beginning, and then leave it alone.  The satellites are much smaller than the Logitech and less cheesy looking, which makes them nicer on your desk.  I have to say again how killer the sound is.  Imaging is great, and it's crazy how they manage to do it with those tiny satellites.\n\nDesk at Home -  M-Audio StudioPro 3 Desktop Audio Monitors\nThese simply have the best sound and imaging of everything I tried except the higher end M-Audio reference speakers.  No MP3 is going to sound ever as good as a CD through a component stereo(or an LP, but don't get me started).  But I am amazed at the quality of these speakers.  They wouldn;t have the power to fill a living room, or even an office.  By the time you're 6'-8' away from them, the imaging settles out a bit.  But for your desk or as satellite speakers for a TV that didn't come with great ones already, they are perfect.  They are a little bigger than many desktop speakers overall, but since many desktop speakers are oddly shaped with leaning towers and wide stands, they actually don;t take up as much more footprint comparatively.  The volume and headphone jack and aux in are all on one of the speakers, very handy for access and for plugging in your iPod at your desk.  I tried several of the higher end M-Audio speakers, and while I found them to be even better with more power and clarity, it just wasn't enough better to justify the additional size and expense.\n\nThere you have it.

I ended up buying all 3 and hooking them up so I could test drive them.  Then returned the ones I didn't keep.  Hopefully someone in the same situation I was in will benefit from my review.  If you can't decide I recommend buying the ones you can't decide between and test them yourself.\n\n  SPEAKERS:\nKlipsch Promedia 2.1, Logitech z-2300, Bose Companion 3\n\n  BACKGROUND:\nPrevious Speakers- Creative 6.1, think they were the original inspires.\nSound Card- Creative x-fi\nPrimary use- Gaming with limited music\nVolume- maybe max out around 10%.  Live in multifamily complex and don't need a lease breaker to live up to its name.\nEar quality- I'm no sound engineer so all references to quality of sound are just what MY ears heard.\n\n  6.1 V 2.1:\nYou will not find any 2.1 system that rivals even a cheap 5.1 or 6.1 set.  No way around that.  In downgrading you are compromising from the start.  If you have the space/cash/mounting locations go with 5.1 or higher.\n\n  SOUND QUALITY:\nThe Klipsch had the best overall performance when it came to sound.  Second was Bose and third was Logitech.\n\nI was not at all impressed with the Logitechs.  They had a nice booming sound but no matter how much I fiddled with the EQ could I get a clean consistent sound across the board.  Highs sounded watered down, Mids sounded muted and the Lows were...booming in a good way.  Granted I'm sure this had a lot to do with the fact that I wasn't turning them up very loud.  When I cranked them up they sounded much better but that's not the situation I needed them for.  If you are throwing a block party the sound quality might be great.\n\nThe Klipsch definitely had the best overall sound.  It seemed to have a little trouble with definition on the highs and the extreme lows but far out did the other two with the mids and the lows.  When I say trouble I mean nothing noticeable if you didn't have multiple speakers hooked up at the same time.  This could once again be attributed to the fact that I'm running them at such a low volume.  As far as the extreme lows, I don't think either of the other two systems even had those lows to listen too.\n\nThe Bose handled the highs with crystal clarity.  They do have the \"tin can\" effect that other reviewers have mentioned but adjustment of the EQ was able to compensate for that.  The mids had to be corrected with the EQ but once setup right they were adequate, nothing to write home about, but better then the Logitech and not as good as the Klipsch.  The lows thumped nicely and seemed to fit well but on extreme lows it seemed to be more of a single rumble as opposed to individual sounds.\n\n  REAL ESTATE:\nThe Bose significantly outshine the other two sets when it comes to desk real estate.  The footprint of each satellite is about 2.5x2.5 inches.  Headphones might take up less space.  The Logitechs and the Klipsch take up about the same amount of space on the desk.  Slightly larger than your average desktop speaker but not so large that you can't fit them on the desk.\n\n  CONTROLS:\nAll three sets had the same set of controls and inputs on them, namely bass, volume, and a miniplug out or two.\n\nI preferred the Bose when it came to the controls.  The little wired remote puck thing works excellently and sticks to the spot you put it.  The volume control consists of turning the outside of the puck and works excellently.  One added feature is the top of the puck is a touch activated mute button.  Useless really since the volume is so easy to adjust but nice all the same.  The bass control for the Bose is located on the back of the sub near the top.  The sub sits under my desk so it's easy enough to adjust by just reaching behind it from the top and turning the knob.\n\nSecond would be the Logitech set.  They also have a wired remote similar to the bose.  Has a couple knobs on it a large (not as large as the bose puck) one for volume and smaller one for bass.  They seemed to turn smoothly and work great.  The one thing I didn't like about the Logitech remote was that it was very light and didn't really stay where you put it.  Some double side tape or a rubber pad would easily fix that.\n\nThis is one spot where the Klipsch comes in last.  I read that the controller could be removed from the speaker but didn't see an easy way to do it and didn't want to muck them up since I would be returning 2 of the 3 systems.  The Klipsch controls are located on the right speaker similar to your normal OEM speakers.  There is a volume and bass knob.  The volume knob didn't seem as smooth as the other two systems and tended to jump as opposed to smoothly increase and decrease the volume.  This might just be that it's a small knob and harder to make precision changes.\n\nThe power button is never a concern of mine because I leave everything on all the time but for those that it is an issue: Logitech had a power switch on the sub and \"sleep\" button on the remote.  Both the klipsch and the bose have the power switches on the back of the sub.  None of the power switches on the back of the subs are easy to get to or locate so if you can handle just putting it in sleep mode I'd recommend the Logitech.\n\n  BUILD QUALITY:\nI don't mean the build of the actual cones but of the housings, stands, etc.  I don't know enough about construction of or speaker materials to make a judgment on the cones and drivers.\n\nI think the Bose probably won in this category with the Logitech coming in second and the Klipsch bringing up the rear.\n\nBoth the Bose and Logitech went together well and everything fit tight.  Everything seemed to be appropriately built with acceptable tolerances in terms of stands and housings.  The Logitech's satellites were mostly plastic with cloth speaker grilles metal grilles on the sub.  The sub was particle board I'm assuming with a metal grille.  The Bose satellites were all metal including stands and grilles.  The sub was particle board I'm assuming with a metal grille.  Moving the speakers around and doing whatever over the course of testing them seemed to have no side effect on the operation of these two sets.  Everything on each system seemed to use a heavy enough gauged wire that I was not concerned with damaging them as I yanked them through the rats nest behind my desk.\n\nThe Klipsch fell short on the build quality.  They used comparable materials as the previous two, plastic satellites with cloth grilles and what I'm assuming is a particle board sub with a metal grille.  The stands for the satellites were cockeyed causing the speakers to lean at some odd angles.  Nothing that your average person would notice but someone in QC should have caught that.  The little ps2 looking cable that connects the controller to the sub didn't fit securely or snap into the sub.  Is to be expected of this style cable but on the other two systems I didn't have any concern if it connected appropriately.  After initial setup of the speakers the left satellite went out on me and I had to jiggle/turn the miniplug plugged into the back of it.  This is nothing new to miniplugs but I would have liked to have had the system setup for a good year before I had to start jiggling stuff.  None of these matters are real deal breakers but I noticed no problems with the other two systems.  It causes me to question what else might not be done as right as it should be done.\n\nOne thing nice about the Klipsch is that the connections for the satellites are normal speaker wire with a miniplug on the end.  Should be fairly easy to rig up your own connectors if the supplied separation distance isn't enough for your needs.\n\n  CONCLUSION:\nIf you want the best sound you can find, go with the Klipsch hands down.  If size is your concern go with the Bose.  Most other items noted are personal taste and opinion so you can make your judgments of off my previous information.\n\n  WHAT'D I KEEP?:\nI kept the Bose.

To Klipsch's credit, I did receive a brand new 4.1 system when their warranty only required them to cover a new subwoofer/power supply.  The two Klipsch systems together lasted about four or five years.  I started with a 4.1 system and eventually speakers broke down, reducing the system to a 2.1 in its final year.\n\nI took a gamble on the Logitech Z-2300 2.1 speaker system, and I'm glad I did.  While the subwoofer's bass isn't as thumpy as Klipsch's, the satellite speakers produce a clear sound without nearly as much distortion as Klipsch.  I also don't hear that \"Klipsch Hiss\" that always bothered me with my ProMedias.\n\nThe many positive reviews and excellent price tag attracted me the most.  So far, I'm happy.  The satellite speakers do not command nearly as much desk space as my old ProMedias.  The subwoofer is just as huge and heavy, but I'm used to having a monster woofer.  I like that the speakers connect via RCAs instead of open-ended speaker wire.  The Z-2300s are also more useful than the ProMedias.  They easily connect to almost any video game console.  I like that the remote control isn't on the speakers as it is with Klipsch's ProMedias.  I like having the remote within reach and comfortably positioned.  The oversized volume dial is nice as well.  To use the on/off switch, you push down; with the ProMedias, you push forward to turn the speakers on and off, and often the main satellite (the one with the on/off switch) slides backwards and the speakers don't shut off.  The position of the headphone jack on the Z-2300s is also nice.\n\nI recommend Logitech's Z-2300 2.1 Speaker System for your computer or video game console.

Z-2300 also beats ProMedia in design with only one wire coming to each satellite (its competitor having three or four to the control console attached to one satellite.) This being said, ProMedia also has its distinctiveness over its Logitech counterpart.\n\nCNET, my favorite review site, gives Z-2300 a wowing 9 star while throwing ProMedia a meager 7.9. I dispute this and believe a difference of 0.5 star might be more appropriate. Compared to Logitech, Klipsch is slightly better in mids and highs. ProMedia sounds a little bit more \"open\" and crispy. In design, the ProMeida is wall-mountable though with the optional brackets and its aesthetic limitations (see my review on Klipsch ProMedia 2.1). Both systems looks a little cheesy, but the ProMedia looks a little bit more \"pro\" with its \"component black\" color than its counterpart which unfortunately uses a silver tone over-emphasizing its plastic nature and bulkiness of the subwoofer.\n\nIn conclusion, both speakers are very good (if not too good) for MP3s and choosing  which one to buy is more of personal tastes than substance in sound quality.

I saw the reviews that said these speakers lack mid-range but went ahead anyway with the thought that good, high-powered 2.1's are probably better than the typical lower quality 5.1's sold with many systems (my 5.1's are from a Dell system purchase).\n\nI planned on using these speakers in the living room for music and movies.  Immediately upon trying, though, I noticed that midrange is missing, which IS important for movies because that's where most of the dialog takes place.  I used my sound card's (Creative Soundblaster Audigy) equalizer but that didn't help much.  I tried different movies and different settings, and I could not get it to be satisfactory.  I also played MP3s on it, and the base overpowered the satellites.  While doing all this, I noticed that if I were close to the speakers, using them as desktop PC speakers, they did a good job.\n\nSo, my conclusions ...\n\nIt all worked out because I moved my Dell 5.1 speakers to my living room, and they do a great job of filling up that amount of space and also getting the midrange, so they work good for movies.\n\nI moved these Logitech Z-2300 2.1's to my dining room computer where I listen to music while sitting at the computer.  That's where these speakers do really well.  Sitting closer, with the sub-woofer beneath the desk, the mid-range does come through.  Having the sub-woofer and volume wired remote lets me adjust the sound really well depending on mood and volume.  Being able to adjust the sub-woofer using the wired remote makes these speakers great desktop-PC speakers.\n\nSo, that's my experience and my verdict.  Great speakers for sitting at the computer.  Not so great speakers in larger areas like the living room, especially when watching movies.  In that case 5.1's are much better at picking up the dialog while still providing enough bass.\n\nUpdate:  I used these speakers while playing the game Command and Conquer Generals, and they rocked!

The Logitech Z-2300 speaker system is THE best 2.1 system you can buy.  Period.  I did a lot of research before I bought these and my efforts payed off big.  The only other comparable systems were the Klipsch THX 2.1 speakers and the BOSE 2.1 system.  I wanted something that was small yet powerful, and not have to spend a fortune.  The BOSE system was way too expensive for me and I wasn't too fond of the styling of the speakers.  The Klipsch system was a little more expensive and several reviews had rated it lower than the Logitech.  At the time, Amazon had a great deal on the Z-2300, so thats what I went with - and I am glad.  I have the speakers connected to my laptop through an external Creative sound card, and the first time I played music I was in heaven.  The THX cetification is not for nothing- the speakers rival my home theater ones in every way.  Whether listening to classical, heavy rock, playing Counter Strike, or watching a movie, the Logitech speakers perform perfectly.  Every single sound, from a piano key to bass rythm to voices to gunshots, is as clear and as loud as can be.  The bass, however, is both the good and the bad of this system.  The subwoofer is massive - luckily I had a spot under my desk where it fits well, but for someone with a small desk and/or a small room, be sure to consider the size of the subwoofer.  However, there is a reason its so huge.  With 400 watts!! of peak power, I can literally move my desk around my room when I turn up the bass.  These speakers are amazing.  To make sure you are sending your speakers the highest quality audio, I recommend using a non-integrated sound card (i.e. Creative Audigy or X-Fi).  My laptop has crappy integrated sound, so I bought an external USB card, which makes a huge difference.\n\n  So, in conclusion, if you are looking for a high quality 2.1 system for your computer or even mp3 player, this is it.  THX certification means you are getting the highest level of sound quality possible, and trust me, these speakers are unlike anything you'll ever hear.

I would compare the quality of sound output on these to the likes of Bose and other high end stereo manufacturers.\n\nFor people interested in a set of multimedia speakers, these are ideal for listening to music and watching TV/Movies.  Most music and television is programmed/mastered to be heard on two channels, so it doesn't make much sense to listen to 2 channels of music through 5 or 7 speakers if you don't need to.  If you're into gaming or watching really intense action films, you may find yourself yearning for more surround sound so that you actually feel like you're \"in\" the experience.  In that case, these speakers are NOT for you, and you should invest in a 5.1 or 7.1 system.\n\nThese speakers are phenomenal.  Amazing lows will blow your socks off, and crisp, clear highs will provide some high definition sound.  I was initially concerned about the midrange, but found that by adjusting the bass levels, I was able to get more mid out of the speakers.

I LOVE these speakers and are actually among the best I have ever heard, even much higher priced speakers (I am very critical when it comes to quality electronics).  -FIVE STARS-"}, "657": {"helpfulness": "22", "rating": 2.0, "text": "I expected a lot from these speakers given their glowing reviews on almost every review site, not to mention their $150 price tag.  They didn't just fall short of expectations; they're so inferior to my decade-old previous set that I'm just going to switch back.\n\nThe professional reviews you may have read are right about a couple things: the high range sound is flawless and crisp, and the subwoofer is powerful enough to implode my apartment.  But there is no midrange at all.  Everything sounds like it's coming from the bottom of a tin can.  Simply put, the satellite speakers sound as teeny as they are.  Equalization doesn't cut it, the capacity to produce those sounds is just not there.\n\nThe result is a cold, unfulfilling sound, kind of like what happens when you connect speakers with too long of a wire.  Speaking of wires, the way these speakers are connected is aggravating.  The satellite speakers are hardwired with 6-foot RCA cables which you have to plug in to the subwoofer.  This basically means you MUST put the subwoofer dead center, under your desk.  I don't know about anyone else's setup, but there is no room for that thing and my feet under my desk.  I had to rummage through my box o' wiring and find a couple RCA extensions so I could put the subwoofer to one side.  I thought at first that was what was causing the tinny sound, but when I removed the extensions as a test the result still wasn't anywhere near acceptable.\n\nThese are going back.

The bass is also stronger (better too) than other friend's Klipsch 4.1 system.  Like many people have said before, the mids are not as apparent as other high-end systems.  However, this has less to do with the speakers and more to do with the powerful sub.

High quality phase plugs in a full-ranged driver sounds better than lower quality drivers and tweeters.  They sound great on my laptop with on-board sound and even better on my Audigy 2 ZS.  I think the overall sound of these speakers are better than Klipsch 2.1's.  The only major gripe I have with this set is the controller wiring which is short and cannot be extended.  Best 2.1's for the price or otherwise."}, "663": {"helpfulness": "636", "rating": 4.0, "text": "I've had these speakers for about six weeks and I think they have a great sound.  I have them hooked up to a new Alienware system with a SoundBlaster X-Fi card.  I use the card for both gaming and music.  The system is located in a 11' x 11' home office with the speakers located at each corner of 5' desk and the subwoofer in front of the desk.\n\nI have switched from a 5.1 system I got with my previous Alienware system.  I'm in my 50's and have seen about every sound gimmick come down the pike.  There are a lot of people who love 5.1 and have time to tweak them, I'm just not one of them.  I've had the 5.1 system for about five years hooked to a SoundBlaster Live card.  I'm pretty adept with computers, so I have kept up with the drivers, played with the balance, moved the speakers and done about everything I can to \"feel\" the game.  I usually play Call of Duty or Far Cry type games.  I also play RTS games of the C&C stripe.\n\nI must be getting old, because I'm tired of screwing around with sound systems.  I'm at a point where I just want to sit down and hear some great sound without going through all of the situational adjustments (FPS game, music, RTS game, SAT TV, etc).  If you just want something that has great fidelity and some oomph in the low range, this is your system.\n\nWhat I like:\n\n1.  The sound for music is fantastic.  I have eclectic tastes in music and all of it sounds great across the board with excellent fidelity.  Some songs you can hear every instrument and note.  It's as good as the source (mp3, wma, etc) can make it.\n\n2.  The stereo effect is wonderful.  It's like having a center speaker without having the clutter of a physical speaker on your desk, plus you still get a great sense of left/right effects.\n\n3.  The subwoofer will rock you.  I have it front of a solid wood desk and it will shake the desk at half bass.  When I play COD or MOH, it's like you are on Omaha beach during an artillery barrage.  It's as real as I need it.  I don't need 5.1 to hear the shell whistling past me to get a great effect.\n\n4.  I really like the control.  It sits well on the desk next to my keyboard.  Nice big dials that index the bass and volume well.  There is good size off switch that is easy to hit if you need to kill the sound quickly without searching for a mute button.  There is also a plug for headphones.  Makes it convenient if you don't want to have to keep reaching around the back of the system.  It also has a blue power light which I prefer.\n\n5.  Very, very, very easy to set up.  Just plug the speakers into the subwoofer and then plug the system cable into the sound card.  Turn it on.\n\n6.  Uses the system software for balance and treble.  It will also use the software equalizer.  You may ask why this is important.  Half my problem with my last set of speakers is that the computer had an equalizer, the installed SoundBlaster software had an equalizer, the player had an equalizer and the speaker system had a equalizer, speaker balance.  Give me a break.  There were four sets of adjustments that you had to manage depending on what you were doing at the time (game, music, TV).  I never knew which control was in control.  My results were mixed at best.  Now I just worry about the computers settings and I get great sound in any of my apps.\n\n7.  I have not detected the irritating hum my last system had during quiet times or when no music was playing.\n\n8.  I like the style of the speakers.  Silver with black cloth covers.  They seem very substantial.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n\n1. I may be old fashioned, but I want the option to change the length of my speaker wires.  I don't know why Logitech has gone this route, but the speaker wire is permanently affixed to the back of the speaker and terminates with an RCA plug.  I prefer heavy gauge speaker wire and would like the option to move the subwoofer farther away.  This requires me to buy expensive RCA cable as opposed to regular speaker wire.\n\n2.  The subwoofer is probably physically bigger than it should be for a small room system.  There is no room for it under the desk (that's why it's in front of it:).  I'm still experimenting with placement.  Make no mistake, this puppy is big.  It also has metal heat vanes on the back that give it additional length.  If you are working with limited space, make sure you pay attention to the dimensions.\n\n3.  While I like the control, it makes placing the subwoofer across the room somewhat problematic.  The wire from the subwoofer to the controller is a 6' long thick proprietary cable.  The system sound plug then runs from the controller to the sound card.  The speakers cords run directly to the subwoofer.  This system is meant for close-in.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis is a great trouble free set of speakers with great sound.  Just plug and play without a lot of fuss.  I knocked off a star because of the limited flexibility imposed by the cabling scheme.  That being said, I don't think you can beat the sound at this price.  To be honest, I have a pretty decent ear and these are as good as any system I have listened to.  I feel my money was well spent and I am most satisfied with my purchase.

What I did was replace the sats with a small pair of 2-way bookshelf speakers I had lying around with a separate tweeter and woofer, and presto!  Much much more enjoyable.\n\nThe other key is, having a decent soundcard behind this system.  I started off with a Creative external USB card.  When I replaced it with the 26 dollar Chaintech av710, the sound improved tenfold: much more detailed and clearer.\n\nFinally, experiment with subwoofer placement.  Putting the sub near a corner or against a wall can make it a lot boomier, so pulling it out further or turning the driver to point away from you can help.\n\nThe main advantage of using this system is the power you get from the sub (I usually have my sub volume at 25-50%) and the simpicity of hooking it straight to your computer's sound card.

Secondly, I just bought this product and, no I don't work for Logitech, or anyone else who`s related to the company, or their distributors.\n\nSetting up:\n\nFor those who are curious a bit about the speaker set up, it is very easy. The subwoofer acts as the \"motherboard\", so to speak. Everything hooks into it, from the back. The subwoofer is the power supply source (there's no adapter, just a standard plug, so this will save room on a power strip), and the wired remote plugs into the sub, and the computer. The satellites plug into the sub as well. If you wish to plug the speakers up something else (a videogame console, a DVD player, VCR, etc.) a RCA splitter cord is provided to hook it up. When plugging this thing up, do NOT plug it up to the electrical socket first and then connect the components. Plug it into the wall last. Additionally, there is a on/off feature on the wired remote, as well as a switch on the back of the sub. The ON LED light on the wired remote is a pretty blue color.\n\nWhen you set up the speakers, you should note that the satellites are very directional sensitive. That is, adjusting the angle of the speakers will have a great deal to do with the how the sound is directed towards your head, and thus the overall quality. Take the time to adjust this to the best sounding position. These speakers are decently compact. My computer is sitting on a tiny IKEA computer desk, along with other studio gear, including two rack-mounted processors. I have plenty of room for these speakers. Do NOT sit these speakers next to your head. It's a good idea to have them farther away from you than your monitor is sitting, if possible. As for the subwoofer, do the smart thing and put it on the floor. It doesn't need to be elevated no more than a foot off the ground, if that much. Also give the sub room to breathe, and for the love of common sense, don't block the side air hole, and don't direct the woofer at your computer tower.\n\nThe Sound:\n\nLike I said before, I am a music producer, additionally I am a classically trained musician with 20 years experience (I'm 28). So I know what I'm talking about. Also I should note that I am using a fairly new desktop computer, an Emachines, which is about a year old. I also have a nice Sony 5.1 stereo system. These speakers kick my Sony's tail, all around. The only way it could be better is if it was a perfect surround sound system, and that would be a pain to deal with, unless you have the room and money for it.\n\nSome people have said the mids on these speakers are weak. I'm not hearing it at all. What I have noticed is that the upper highs are very strong. If you are having this problem here's simple solution. I'm using Windows Media Player 9.0. On the \"rock\" EQ setting just move the 16kHz level down a wee bit. If you're using another kind of media player, just turn down the EQ between 12-20kHz down by 5-10%. If you're hearing hiss out of the speakers then you might have them too close to your head to begin with (I can only hear it when I lean over next to it, and if the volume is past 60%). Otherwise, you might have a shielding problem.\n\nThese speakers are quite loud. Be careful not to damage your hearing with these. I really see no point in turning the master volume past 40% and the sub past 25%.\n\nAlso keep in mind that these speakers are quality. Don't play hip hop on a classical EQ setting. You should get used to switching your EQ setting (which is easy enough on Windows Media Player) for the appropriate thing you are listening to. If you're listening to talk radio, set it to \"speech\", and turn the woofer down to zero.\n\nThe only draw back on this speaker system is that you can't turn the woofer down to perfect zero, meaning that you can't bypass it. That would be a good bonus. But turning down the EQ in the 20Hz to 50 Hz range should do the trick if you want to by pass it.\n\nFor this price, these speakers are a steal. The quality of these things in my opinion are triple the price, if not more.\n\nThe z2300 as well deserving of 5 stars. If you want killer sound on your computer without spending a few thousand bucks, this is the way to go. I bought these for my home studio to mix the record I'm working on, and I'm so glad I did it. It far beats spending $400 on a single studio monitor.\n\nIf anyone wants so advice or semi-technical assistance as far as these speakers are concerned, I'd be more than glad to offer some advice if you wish, just email me at GSFU (at) aol (dot) com."}, "687": {"helpfulness": "5", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Let's just keep this short and sweet.

At the same time, I purchased the Creative Audigy 2 ZS sound card to replace my Biostar motherboard's onboard sound. I wanted something that sounded good. After reading many, many reviews, I was stuck on a decision to buy Logitech's Z-5300e or the Z-2300. I decided to go with the 2.1 setup since I would mostly be listening to music. I don't play that many games, and I definitely don't watch movies on the computer, and rarely on TV, either.\n\nThe speakers arrived a day before the sound card (ordered from two different stores), so I went ahead and gave them a test drive with the onboard sound card. The loudness and deeper bass was there, and the quality was a little better. I was about to regret the speaker purchase, but decided I'd wait until I got the Sound Blaster card.\n\nThe card arrived. After installation, I played the demos which shipped with the card and some MP3's. I even slipped in a DVD movie. I was impressed with everything. I couldn't believe the difference in how the speakers sound with a good sound card. It's like being in a movie theater. The bass is easily tamed, but it can most definitely shake your floors with the right music and volume.\n\nDon't forget to try out the THX demo which Logitech ships with the speakers. You can install the demo or to save hard drive space, you go directly to the CD to play the files. Lots of other samples, but you have to look for them in Program Files or on the CD. Perhaps one of the many applications Logitech gives you lists these sample music files.\n\nNow, my only regret is should I have gotten the Z-5300e 5.1 speakers for a few dollars more, but probably not since my listening agenda will be music. The PC is in a small room (sunroom) with ceramic floors, so I think the Z-2300 set is more than sufficient. They can get very, very loud. Two more speakers in the rear (and a center) probably wouldn't matter much since this is a smaller room with not much sound absorbers. I remember the rear speakers with the old 4.1 set were barely noticeable, anyway. Maybe I'll reinstall them just to listen how they sound with SoundBlaster.\n\nI'll give these five stars because of the price and the quality I heard.

Obviously, the system is not for audiophiles but if you are looking for big bass from an inexpensive system, I don't think you will disappointed. What is even more amazing is I hooked them up to a very cheap Panasonic boombox for the heck of it and got incredible sound. I was stunned at what I could hear.

The highs are just as poor, but not because they are overstated and muffled, but because they do not exist.

I got so used to these speakers' full piano sound fidelity that I never bought a pro keyboard amp.  It would have upgraded only the screeching power of my sound equipment, which after all I (and my neighbors) prefer not to have at home.  This holiday season, armed with a gift card and tired of constantly moving my speakers to the digital piano and back to the PC, I tested several far more expensive and far less satisfying solutions at Guitar Center. I still find good computer speakers' sound to be richer, except on far more expensive studio monitor speaker systems.  And so I went to my local computer store and bought a Logitech Z-3 following a salesperson's suggestion. They lacked power, especially in the middle range, so after reading some reviews online I replaced them with Z-2300.  Good, rich sound. After I lower the bass control to the minimum the piano sounds great, but it's lacking some extra highs and middles that my old Cambridge Soundworks has.  It is great for the system to have the extra capacity and power for an extra kick when needed, but I prefer \"keeping my lows low\" on this one to get it to sound normal.  With bass control set at the max it sounds insane and I get a feeling Logitech Z-2300 actually belongs to the back of one of those cars which manage to annoy everybody within a 100 ft radius at the traffic light. I still haven't decided which system will end up with the computer and which with the keyboard, but the Logitech system is far more powerful as it has an extremely rich lower range, so it's probably great for movies with special effects and \"disco\" music.

So I bought the M-Audio Sonica Theater and boy, the sound coming from the z-2300 is a lot more defined and crisp.\n\nHowever, I'm not sure if spending $84 (the cheapest, yet best quality sound card for a Mac I could find) for the subtle improvement in an already great sound was worth it. With the sound card, the Bass is a lot more defined, but the energy and power is significantly reduced. I don't really mind, since definement is good, but I guess it depends on what you want.\n\nI did find one quibble with these speakers before I got the soundcard, however. When played at low volumes, the sound does not blend very well; the sound actually blends better when you turn it up! ; )  But combined with the computer volume control, venturing past 85% causes distortion and the Bass goes flat. A sound card would take care of these problems though.\n\nBottom line, if you are one who doesn't mind the minor lack of \"sound blending\" at low and high volumes, and better Bass definement, a sound card is unnecessary, as these speakers rock.
