I ended up having to place it fairly high on my headphone cord to get it close enough to my mouth to capture good audio instead of the sound from my air conditioner, computer, or children down the hall.\n\nUnfortunately, the flaw I found with this microphone is that the cable is WAY too thin and WAY too long.  This had the advantage of placement where you wanted, but it was very easy to get wrapped up in the cable or, in my case I accidentally ran it over with my computer chair.  once.  and because the cable is thin, it severed the cable on the inside.  I know that this technically qualifies as \"abuse\", but I would have hoped that it would hold up to a bit more than one wheel running it over.  there were no external signs that the cable was bad, but when you plug it in, it doesn't give an audio signal.\n\nOverall I ended up going with a mic boom stand, a vocal mic, and a mixing board (as I needed them for another project and found that they integrated well with my computer setup), but if I pick one of these up for more portable use with my laptop, I think i'll end up using the coiled headphone cable in attempt to protect the mic cable to try to avoid the pitfall of the thin cable.\n\nOverall for the incredibly low price, this really isn't a bad mic.

However, the only way to achieve this sound was to put the mic directly in front of my mouth, maybe an inch from my lips. Clipping it to my headphone cable and talking would leave my voice distant or not really picked up at all unless I boosted the Mic volume by 20-30 dB. I managed to combine a hook + part of an old broken headset + the mic , then hook it onto my headphones to create a sort of headset mic attachment for myself with the mic in front of my mouth, which worked pretty well.\n\nHaving to boost the mic also made it so the mic picked up a good deal of background noise like the computer fans and just general white noise. Since I pretty much just used this mic for talking on Discord, the noise suppression from Discord's settings was able to mitigate most of it, so it wasn't as much of a problem. The noise suppression setting on my computer was making my voice sound strange so I didn't use it. After configuring settings here and there, I found the Mic clarity was pretty great when the mic is in front of my mouth, and the computer's noise suppression/echo cancellation are turned off. The clarity was even better using Discord's noise suppression and other voice settings.\n\nHowever, after using the mic for a few months on and off, it suddenly just stopped working. It was detected on my computer, and outputed white noise. Then, also spontaneously, the mic started working again after a day. I'm really not sure why it stopped working or started working again.\n\nBut all in all, it's an okay mic, good for the price, but you will have to configure some settings, maybe build some contraption to put the mic in front of your mouth, and then your soundcard/software will probably make a difference.

I bought this mic with standalone earphones in order to stay away from the way overpriced \"gaming\" headset market. Put simply the mic works great, but had a fatal flaw. Here's my pro and con list:\n\nPROS:\n- Sound quality is great. I had no static over the line, it easily picked up my voice, and surprisingly it didn't pick up too much background noise for being an open mic decently far from my mouth.\n- The main wire clip stays put. It never fell off the entire time using it.\n\nCONS:\n- The small clips along the wire that are supposed to hold it on the main wire of your headset are basically useless. They are very small and cheap, and they constantly fell off. I eventually just stopped trying to use them. So while it stays connected at the mic very well the wire will hang independently from there. This can be slightly annoying with tangled wires and the like, and probably led to my next issue.\n- This is the big one: the wire has a fairly hard thin plastic cover. This leads to a brittle cord that easily cracks without much strength to keep it from bending. At the time of writing this review my mic has just recently broken and no longer works because of this issue. I treat my equipment well, but the hard plastic wire casing still completely cracked through leaving the internal wire exposed. Without the structure of the surrounding plastic the wire itself soon lost connectivity. If the wire clips along the wire worked better it would have been able to parasitically use the strength of the thick headset cord to prevent bending, but that wasn't the case.

You know, the long-necked white/wide based design that every foreign company under the sun has made one of. Mine was steadily dying, becoming less sensitive to voice and more so to background noise. And so the search began.\n\nA few Googlings later, I came across this little Zalman mic. There are reviews that say it's not sensitive enough, others that complain about the fidgety \"clip\", but I decided to give it a go. At $7.79 at the time of purchase, I figured at worst I could manually hold it up to my mouth at those times when I *really* needed a mic.\n\nAddressing the two above problems...\n\nThe mic isn't terribly sensitive. Plugged in and microphone boost off, it's far too quiet to be useful. However, with microphone boost enabled, it is sensitive enough for speech to register about 50% up Teamspeak's volume test scale when clipped somewhere below your face (say...to a cord), and about 45% when stuck to the side of a monitor roughly 2ft away from the face.\nWith that high of a boost, though, it does catch a fair amount of background noise, and will definitely catch computer fan/drive noise if your case is open or just loudish. Teamspeak has (pretty good) noise filtering that will remove 90%+ of noise from fans and such; I'd imagine most any decent voice chat program does. Using the filtering in a chat program is definitely preferable to sound card filtration, at least if using Realtek sound, as its filtering over-compresses the audio and makes it sound terrible.\n\nThe clip isn't a clip, it's a V-shaped bit of plastic that sufficiently large cords can be wedged into. A pair of headphones made for music/movies/personal gaming (those with around-ear pads, like) will probably have a nice, thick cord, which works perfectly. Thinner cords, like those found on lighter/MMO gaming headphones and earbuds probably won't be able to use it. On the other hand, once the microphone boost is cranked up, the mic is sensitive enough that you can lay it on the desk or stick it to your monitor and it'll work fine, so this isn't really a dealbreaker. A proper sprung clip would have been nice, but then we'd be dealing with either a higher price point or a likely flimsy clip.\n\nSo, is it a good mic? Yes, for $8ish, it's a very good mic. It's not faultless, but for the price you really can't go wrong.\nIf you need high sensitivity out of the box, though, you may want to look elsewhere. Ditto for hardware background noise filtering/cancelling, as this microphone has absolutely none built in.\n\nSo finally, obligatory pros/cons;\n\nPros:\n*Small, very light\n*Clips onto larger headphone cords and holds well\n*Sound comes through adequately loud and clear with microphone boost and noise filtering on, and will consistently pick up clean voice from a couple feet away plus if needed\n*Long cord, something like 8-10ft\n*Cheap!\n\nCons:\n*Clip isn't a clip, and the narrowest point in it isn't narrow enough to fit smaller headphone/earbud cords\n*Way too quiet by itself, needs software help to get its output up to useable levels, at which point it picks up moderate levels of background noise\n*No built-in noise filtering, literally a microphone connected to a cable and that's it\n*As others have pointed out, the 3.5mm plug is bulky; it should fit with other plugs in onboard or front panel outlets, but sound cards with closely-spaced outlets will have issues"}, "911": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "I'm surprised with the quality that this little mic produces.

In an environment with background noise, you will have to find a way to clip it close to your mouth to allow for a low enough input volume that cancels out background noise while still picking up your voice.

The only real complaint I have is that my friends on ventrilo noticed when I got this mic. They say that they can hear me, but it's not as clear as my old one (which was a Logitech G930 headset). I haven't had any issues with anyone (on ventrilo or teamspeak 3) incapable of understanding what I say.

There's also three mini-clips meant for helping it attach to a length of wire and not get tangled, but the mini-clips come off on their own very easily. However, the main clip would never come off unless you deliberately pulled on it.\n\nDURABILITY (5/5)\nThis mic a very light piece of plastic-- too light to break or crack should you drop it on the floor. The only way to damage this would probably be accidentally stepping on it. I've had this mic for over a year (since 10/2012), and there hasn't been any issues yet.\n\nMISCELLANEOUS\nThis may be a pro or con-- the cord is very long, perhaps 10 feet.

However, doing voice recording for anything else would require a better microphone.\n\nI have Googled a lot and asked lots of people for any help, but I have found nobody with an answer to my problem.

Pair with nice headphones and it gets the job done for gaming. More than adequate for Skype and other voice programs. But not as clear or functional as a gaming microphone for regular gamers. Would fail to meet most standards if you were wanting to do audio recordings for podcasts or youtube videos.\n\nLike many people, I wanted a mic to go with my high quality headphones. My PC headset with built in mic had speakers that were pretty shoddy, so this seemed like a no brainer. Use my high quality music headphones with this mic instead of spending $100 or so on a gaming headset? Yeah!\n\nAnd it works in that regard to some degree. The mic clips to your headphone cable, so it's mostly out of the way, and not immediately in front of your mouth. This is nice, but also works against the mic. To compensate for this, the mic is omni-directional, so it picks up sound in all directions and is highly sensitive. So most importantly, your voice does come through fairly clear. But it also picks up anything else in the room. Fans, keyboard noises, mouse noises, dogs shuffling by, and whatever else you can think of. Without noise canceling, it's a live line.\n\nNow for things like Skype and Google chats, I wouldn't imagine this to be a problem. If you need a mic for that purpose, look no further. The quality is good for the price, the sound comes through mostly clear, and you'll be understood by your friends. A sound purchase.\n\nFor gamers, this means this mic is almost required to be a solely push-to-talk mic. That's not necessarily a bad thing in a larger group, but with just a handful of friends and I, we like to use the voice activated transmitting in Mumble and Vent so we're not forced to press the key constantly. For this purpose, the mic worked... so so. With no mute switch, I had to software mute the program if somebody came into the room to talk to me. Luckily you can bind these keys with the software, but just something to keep in mind. Also, since the mic was picking up so much background chatter, I had a much harder time setting it to recognize when I was talking versus typing, putting my drink down on the desk, moving the mouse, etc. Once again, these are only issues if you use voice activated transmission.\n\nBut even with push-to-talk enabled, the sound quality is distant. Comparing it to other mics I have, it sounds like you are speaking away from the mic. My friends said I always sound like I'm away from the computer a little bit. Kind of tin can sounding. Clear enough? Sure. Just not all that loud and audible. Not as good as my relatively cheap Xbox/PC headset mic (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Xbox-360-Sharkoon-X-Tatic-SX-Stereo-Gaming-Headset/dp/B004EDSBYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Xbox 360 Sharkoon X-Tatic SX Stereo Gaming Headset</a>) which rests closer to the mouth. For this reason, I preferred using the headset and sacrificing my listening quality so my friends could hear me loud and clear. I've also done recording comparisons, and when it is placed in the \"clip\" position on the headset wire, it is by far the quietest mic I have and picks up a lot of white noise. However, sound quality DOES improved quite a bit as you move it closer to your mouth. This kind of makes you want to lean down a little while talking and that's not a terribly convenient feature.\n\nI gave this item 4 stars because it does exactly what it advertises. It works. And for the price, it works fine. But those expecting an extremely clear and functional mic should temper their expectations. Sound tests of the mic can be found on Youtube, and you'll hear some of the \"tinny\" and \"distant\" sound with lots of background \"noise\" that I referenced in this review. I don't regret buying it, since it's served me well for 6 months now without much fuss, but it also lead me to buy a nicer gaming headset and research higher quality PC microphones such as the Snowball and Blue Yeti. If you want quality sound, and have the cash (~$60-$100), look into those two brands and you'll find exactly what you need.

It is fairly sensitive to noises close to the mic, but rejects distant sources. For example, if I sit at my laptop and hold the mic near my face, it will only hear my voice. It won't hear my laptop's fans. But if I move the mic close to the hinge between my laptop and its screen, then it picks up the fan noise very clearly.\n\nThe only problem for me is that this is a microphone that expects \"plug-in power.\" That is, it has a \"stereo\" 3.5mm TRS jack that expects power at the ring. If you have a PC laptop with a microphone port, then you are probably good. Also, some portable recording devices with microphone jacks will work well. What won't work well is a Macbook Pro, or an outboard audio interface designed for professional audio microphones. The Macbook Pro has a line in jack, but that jack expects a stereo signal - one channel on the tip and another on the ring. It also expects that signal to be at line-level voltage. So if you plug this microphone into your mac, you won't hear a thing. The signal is too weak, and the mac doesn't provide the power it needs to boost its own signal (I assume a condenser capsule is used inside this mic).\n\nFortunately, I've got a Sony M10 (which appears to be no longer available from Amazon, or I'd like to it here) which does provide \"plug-in power\". With PiP turned on on the Sony, this mic is great. As described above, it is quite sensitive to nearby sounds, but rejects everything else. The Sony allows me to make use of the mic with my mac (it has a line out that I can run into my mac or my external MOTU audio interface) as well as record interesting ambient sounds.\n\nTL;DR You can't just plug an audio mic into a mac, sorry.

Great if you already have a headset. This attaches to your headset cable easily.\n\nCons: If you don't have a headset you will need one. My first mic broke (MY FAULT) you cannot throw it on the ground or drop it on the ground. I have hard wood floors and I think I wasn't gentle enough with it. I bought two more since they were so cheap and wrap my second mic up after use.

It is a hard plastic molded notch that gets tighter.  Not a spring loaded clip.  So if your cable is not thick enough I could see how this mic would not hold on to it so well.  Also the clips on the wire are small and rubber so again if your cables were to big I could see them not fitting.  The mic is omni-directional so if your in a room with others or a lot of noise it could get picked up.  But that can be corrected by adjusting mic sensitivity with whatever program your using.

When wearing the headset I can't see the microphone as it sits on the headphone chord. After I put on the headset It seems like I'm just wearing a pair of headphones that I can talk to. It's great! The only issue I can see causing any problems is that the chord length is not adjustable but it is very long so if you have headphones with a short chord you will have to find a way to take up the slack. But the clips built onto the chord to attach the microphone to the headset work well letting you twist the microphone chord around the headphone chord turning the 2 chords into 1 esentially. You might have to redo twisting the mic chord around the headphone chord once or twice to get it to twist perfectly but after you get it set you won't have to do it again. I also used a small twist tie by the connectors to keep the mic and headphone cables together by the jack. All in all it works flawlessly and I would definately recommend this microphone with the headset I mentioned earlier for an incredible gaming headset.
