Lost my original sub in a flood about 5 1/2 years ago, have lived in an apartment since then, knew I could never really enjoy a sub living there. *Flash forward to the present*. I recently bought a bi-level home and the first thing I did was purchase this Polk subwoofer. I'm running an Onkyo TS-DX484 (yes, circa 2001. It's been a workhorse) 500 watt Home theater system, original Onkyo center & rear surrounds(meh), JBL fronts. Music sounds great, movies are great. I'm not an audiophile or snob, but I'm a musician and I've played in local bands since I was 14 (now 51) so I do know what sounds good. This Polk sub does the job for me."}, "5": {"helpfulness": "12", "rating": 1.0, "text": "This has been a pretty poor soundly subwoofer to start out with.  Worse yet, it died after a few months.

That thing is pretty heavy and will probably cost a bit to ship it back.  Since I got it cheap with a promotion code it is probably not worth it.  Not happy."}, "6": {"helpfulness": "12", "rating": 3.0, "text": "Based on all the great reviews I was expecting a bit more from this Sub.  I have 2 Polk Monitor 60's for front, CS1 Center, and Monitor 30's for surrounds.  My Monitor 60's go head to head with this sub and have better characteristics on all but the lowest frequencies that this sub handles.  While the unit is taking some of the load from my speakers you would be better served going with a higher quality sub based on my own music and movie tests. The good news is the sub does perform well overall but will not give the cleanest sounding bass response.  For movies it does add some punch but for music I found its characteristics particularly lacking.  I started with my sub at 1/3 and adjusted up to half volume and then calibrated my system.  I did not want to overpower the sub and have the bass sound become too boomy.  Unfortunately even at these modest settings the PSW10 while sounding good does not add much additional range as my front Channels can hit 38Hz.  I tried the THX standard of 80Hz crossover to relive my towers from having to hit the lower frequencies.  All in All for the price its not bad, but if you can afford it I would recommend stepping up to the PSW-505 or a similar 12\" Sub that has a bit more range.\n\nFrom the research I've done if you want an ultra high quality sub for music the SVS SB 1000 series is an outstanding value but runs about 500$.  If you have smaller speakers and need this to fill out the low end it should do the job very well to enhance any sat speaker system on a budget.  The PSW10 is still a good value but for my purposes it just didn't add much to my setup.  I tested using many types of music and most sounded good, however anything with low frequencies just didn't sound as clean as I like.  For the price I paid I will keep the unit and eventually upgrade and use this to add the lower end to my other TV.  Outstanding value overall for a basic sub to add some thump to movies but in my opinion just doesn't have the range to add depth when paired with good tower speakers, your mileage may vary and with some adjusting it can sound acceptable for part of the range it handles.  It will miss some of the really low range that you may want for HT use.  In my tests sound of the low end spectrum did vary, for anything with ultra deep frequencies it was muddied and if you put it even at 50% volume you will get port noise(Polk recommended to set between 12 and 2)\\ on the volume) but that was too much in my tests and created really boomy and poor sound.  For anything in moderately deep areas it did well enough to add some depth but will certainly not compete with a sub 3X its price which in reality no one should expect it to.  You get what you pay for holds true for this sub despite all the great reviews, good value as an entry SW but don't expect this unit to bring out subtle characteristics in music.  If your expectations are right you should be happy with the value it brings.  I have already ordered the Dayton Sub-1200 to replace this unit as it just doesn't work well for my tower speakers, also setting the towers to 60Hz really filled out the sound effects in my room.  They can hit down to 38Hz but not cleanly so I adjusted to keep the sound as level as possible so my frequency response is good. I will update this review with additional information once I have the Dayton 12\" fully calibrated and tested which from what I read competes with well with the PSW505 which is double the price.\n\nUpdate: After dropping sub back to 1/3 power it blends well with my tower speakers for movie watching.  I tested using action intense movies including helicopter flyby's in Transformers and it worked well for this.  I also have a large room approximately 20X17 with vaulted ceilings and the kitchen and second floor is also open to this room.  The sub fills the sound stage in the whole family room with only one slight dead spot which is impressive considering my room is so open.  I do recommend for HT movie watching but cant give a good rating for music.  If movies are 90% of what you use it for then this sub is a bargain for what it does.  Keep in mind though there are a few other subs also rated with slightly better range in this price category including the Dayton sub-1000 and sub-1200.  Some reviewers of the Sub1200 are saying its comparable to the Polk PSW505 which if its even close to that it is a steal.  Any louder then 1/3 volume on the PSW10 for me causes the sub to be boomy and not blend, so if your looking for just a descent boost without needing earth trembling bass its a good price and matches well with Polk speakers.  For me based on my research the only subs I would consider at this price point would be the PSW10 and the Dayton Sub-1000/Sub-1200.  After that price jumps up quite a bit for the performance gains. Excellent value overall but 3stars for music for me and 4 for HT use as long as you keep the volume low for clean output.\n\n**Final update: Well the Dayton Sub-1200 kicks the crud out of the PSW10, clean even at loud levels and is just overall richer and better in low frequency response.  I'm actually sorry I bought the Polk before finding out about the Dayton, it does not have the port noise issue in my tests and sounds much better for music as well  I hooked the Polk up to one of my TV's and it sounds even worse then before because its not using the sub out.  I have to keep it at very low volume.  I would return it but its not worth it due to shipping costs.  I believe Polk missed the ball as the port noise is a big issue, the other thing about the Dayton is you can crank it up and it doesn't hurt your ears, the bass sounds accurate not boomy and painful.  My wife complained about the Polk, the bass was not natural and clean like the Sub-1200 which really extends the range of my speakers and hits all the way down to 25Hz.  Really to my the Dayton is the one to get as its the same price and is just so much more woofer for your money.  Some may actually favor the un-natural boominess of the Polk but not me!"}, "7": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Does a fine job filling up a rec/media room about 20x25.

You'd think that for being so cheap, you would be loosing out on quality, but this thing will surprise you. I'm extremely picky when it comes to sound. I can tell good subwoofers from the poor quality, crackly ones.\n\nFor starters, this thing makes my entire room shake. Whether it be music or a movie. With music, any genre sounds amazing with this. Any heavy bass songs will definitely give a deep, low boom sound.\n\nI noticed other reviewers say that this thing might not be for the movie watchers, but I strongly disagree. During movies, this thing tackles everything. Explosions, no problem. Long helicopter scenes, no loss of bass over time. Me and my girlfriend are going through all the Harry Potter movies right now, and during the climactic scenes, they like to shove a lot of long, drawn out bassy rumbles. This subwoofer never loses power, never crackles, never sounds fuzzy. It remains deep and true throughout the whole thing.\n\nI usually don't go higher than half this things capacity, and I'll sometimes get complaints from people on the other side of our house (and we don't have a modern day, hollowed out plastic house. We have an old, solid, thick wall house). If I have music playing loud, and I leave the room (door close) and go downstairs, it reminds me of when a car drives by your house that has extremely loud subwoofers blasting. If I do the same while a movie is playing, it reminds me of standing right outside of a movie theater room.\n\nDown the road, I plan on setting up a small movie theater set up in the living room, and I think I'll get another one of these to have on each side of the room.\n\nDefinitely good for watching movies, despite what other people have said. And before I got this, I had completely spoiled ears from having extremely powerful stereo setups (I am one of those people that can drive by your house and vibrate your china cabinet with my car's subwoofers that I had mentioned earlier)."}, "16": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 3.0, "text": "Unit doesn't turn on unless the volume is high, not sure if my amplifier is under powers or not.

My music listening and movie watching experience have greatly improved because of it.\n\nThe only negative thing about it (maybe minor for some people) is the power consumption when it's \"turned off\" (red light on). I used a \"kill a watt\" to measure it's power consumption. It still takes 5.7 Watt when it's off. My cable modem uses 5.7 Watt when it's On! When the subwoofer is on and plays music, it takes about 10 Watt which is very good. I'm just diappointed with the fact that it still takes substantial power when it's off.

If you are only wanting to invest a few hundred dollars in your home theater experience and would like to develop your system slowly then this is the sub for you. I had this sub in an apartment and it was a bit too loud at times. However, I doubt a subwoofer that's quiet enough for an apartment really exists.\n\nWith that said, I did love this sub and only recently decided to upgrade after 4 years of owning it without any problems at all. I did not upgrade because the sub wasn't functioning properly, but because I had experienced how great getting this sub was and had started to realize it's limitations (35-40 hrtz is pretty high for a sub and it gets some port noise once you get to this frequency range). This subwoofer is great for music and is a bit less.. detailed.. for the home theater. You get a lot of oomph and just enough detail to whet your appetite and give you a baseline for when the upgrade bug bites. As I said earlier, if you are new to the home theater experience and don't want to invest a lot then this is the sub for you. If you have a lot of experience with home theater equipment you will be impressed by the output on this little guy for $100, but you won't be blown away by the level of detail.\n\nIf after a few years you decide to upgrade from this subwoofer I would strongly recommend the BIC PL-200. I am amazed by the level of clarity that this upgrade provides for the price range (about $300). However, due to the level of detail you may not enjoy a higher end subwoofer until you have spent hours playing with your sound levels to match the rest of the sound system. I was not immediately impressed by my upgrade and it took two days and a full movie of playing with sound settings to get it just right. You won't find a worthwhile upgrade from this PSW10 until you get to the $300 range. If nothing else, that should definitely let you know how good this subwoofer is. There are better ones for twice the price, but I've dug through a ton of forums and researched a lot of upgrade options (I originally only wanted to spend $200 on my upgrade) but there were very few people or articles that recommended that price jump from the PSW10 due to the marginal return you will get at twice the value."}, "59": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "If your more into the quality of the sound than chest pumping bass then this sub is for you....now don't get me wrong this thing rocks and carries very well fills out a 20x20 room great"}, "60": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "This was just what I needed.

I placed the sub in the right front corner of the room. I have gone through two sets of speakers to go with this sub - 1st, I had a decent satellite system and now I have Polk towers (Monitor 55T) and the Monitor 15C center channel. I have the sub crossover set to the max and my receiver set to 80Hz so the sub is not asked to play a wide range of notes.\n\nWith the satellite speakers, this sub worked great for movies. Very clean sound (for my untrained ears) and seems to hit pretty nice - not room rattling, but very noticeable. I tried setting the sub to 100 Hz, but it was asking a little too much from this sub, so I set it back to 80 Hz knowing I would have no midrange. When listening to medium to high volume and the volume of the sub set to just over half, this things sounds really nice. When listening to a movie at low volumes, I wanted more. Overall, I liked the setup, but I felt the midrange was lacking so much that I had to upgrade the satellites. The sub did not ever overpower the small speakers.\n\nWith my new Polk Towers and Center channel, this sub is just not enough. The towers definitely pick up the midrange I was missing, but now the sub is not powerful enough to keep up. It gets lost when playing too loud and when at mid volume, I just want more now that I have better speakers to go with the sub.\n\nFor music, I think the sub sounds like garbage... I am not sure if it is the room, or what, but it just doesn't hit hard or clean enough. I have seen some people using this as their computer sub and it may sound nice, but with my experience, I cannot recommend it for use with music.\n\nIn conclusion, when I have the money I will upgrade to something a little bigger now that I have decent speakers - I know they are not high end by any means, but they do out perform this sub. I will then be very happy making this my secondary system in my bedroom where it will be well balanced with my satellite system.\n\n5 Stars all the way for an $80 sub that blends very well with small speakers."}, "77": {"helpfulness": "2", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Looks great.

Enter the Polk, at a very reasonable price, and the system takes on a real transformation with rich bass especially in the lower strings, and the mid-range sounds even better than before, since the 8\" drivers are now relieved of having to produce any of the real lower frequencies.\n\nI decided to wire the system according to one of the options in the Polk manual, whereby you run the right and left high level speaker outputs from the receiver directly to the sub, then connect the main speakers to the speaker output terminals on the sub, using the subs internal circuitry, crossovers etc. to control what goes to the main speakers and what goes to the sub.  Since the sub has controls for matching the phasing between speakers and sub as well as the crossover point and the subs volume, you can easily create the perfect transition between main speakers and sub and get the overall sound you want.

When I was looking into buying a sub for my home theater system most reviews were really good for the sub with the didn't explain exactly what I needed to know just remember the subs were provided for power than the average person will ever need overall I am very happy with my purchase if you looking for something that's going to bring your games to life with a decent sound system this is it if you looking for something that's going to bring your movies to life this is it things like the cars movies, the matrix, the Star Trek movies and so much more these movies come to life just with having the rights sub a for cons go when and if something pops up all update. But at this time there are pros across the board just remember you looking at easy set up extraordinary power, room shaking bass(but still smooth) a really good price having said all that I would have to say I would recommend this to a friend and I would say get it while you can before it goes out of stock or the price skyrockets for some strange reason and also keep in mind that the subwoofer's coming from a reputable company and manufacturer"}, "120": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 3.0, "text": "I am not going to give this subwoofer one star because I know for most, it will be capable of pleasing you. For me, this sub is very cheap in low note production. The power it puts out is weak, but not non-existant.\nWhen I had it, it was decent for movies, but by no means good. It simply gives its user bass, not good bass.\nThe bass is inaccurate at times and wimpy sounding (as mentioned above). The subwoofer does not hit the lows at very well either. It will just cut them off, there is no slow roll off, but that is expected with a ported sub.\nTurn the volume past half on these and you are begging for trouble. With the gain (volume) that high, the amp installed on it will start to clip and will ruin your sub. The bass becomes louder of course, but extremely loud, even more inaccurate, and boomy. For those familiar with Kicker car audio, it will sound like a low level Kicker Comp with a cheap amp at high volumes.\nIf you want to use these for music, look elsewhere quickly! They will leave you disappointed IF you are more than an average listener like me, and I am by no means an audiophile.\nAfter a week, I returned these exactly how I got them. On here I paid $108 shipped to Texas with tax. When Amazon got it back, the charged me $28 for the free super save shipping, so I only got $80 back. That made me sick since I paid $30 to pretty much test these for a week. Consequently, I did two weeks of research so that I would be sure my next setup would not leave me disappointed again. I looked at reviews on the Polk PSW505 and BIC F12 to prepare for another set that would be sued for 70% movies and 30% music. I could not commit to either or do to various known issues on both of those powered subs.\nSo in the end I got a ported sub box made to about 2.5 cube. It was tuned to 29hz and had a cutout on the back for a plate amp. I got it finished in black carpet because I wanted it to look good without spending a fortune to get it painted cherry or something. Again, for those familiar with car audio, you know the normal black carpet used in mobile sub box installs.\nI then got a digital 500w Bash plate amplifier from Parts Express and paired it with a 15\" Polk Audio MM SVC subwoofer capable of handling 420 watts nominal (RMS).\nTALK ABOUT LOWS! The new setup is an SQ guys/gals dream! It digs deep, gets loud, and still sounds good. It is also very accurate and not boomy at all, despite being ported.

Not very heavy so it's easy to move from place to place if needed with minimal effort.\nNow something I should mention. I do not use this sub for movies and as a home theatre unit. I am a music producer, so I use this sub with my studio monitors just to get a clearer view of my low end when mixing and this sub is absolutely excellent with that. The lows are very deep and precise which is just what I need.\nOn the other hand, the sub is not very powerful. It sure feels like more than 50 watts but really not much more. Let's say that it's not made to be very loud. With a pair of 8\" studio monitors, the sub doesn't have to be turned up very loud, but I could only imagine that in a home theatre setup, this sub would struggle a bit.\nSo quality is good at low volume, but really isn't meant for much more than that. Also something very annoying about this sub is that when you do turn the volume up, the port noise begins to really bother you. Polk clearly didn't make the port large enough as the noise it makes comes in way before the sub itself begins to distort.\nBut for me paying 80$, I really couldn't have expected any better."}, "137": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "This is a really nice subwoofer for the price.

My wife's first comment was, 'It can't be set up right because nobody would buy subwoofers if they sounded that bad.'\n\nBecause of the so many great reviews, I assumed their must be a way to make it work. I used the RCA cables, set the phase 0, made sure the connection was direct from the amplifier (Denon AVR-1513), the volume turned down to half, and tried different room positions (15'X20'). No change improved the sound! I listened for 20 hours of use to see if the quality would improve. But it never changed. Even half volume didn't help. The distortion was so bad that it sounded better off completely.\n\nWhen I returned it, the very helpful Best Buy tech guy and I first compared their floor model to the second best subwoofer in Polk's PSW level (low powered category) -the 10\" PSW110. And, what a relief! The PSW110 (100W RMS) sounded MUCH better. It sounded fuller than the PSW10 (50W RMS) floor model (which sounded exactly as bad as the one I was about to return from home). The PSW110 hummed pitch that couldn't even be heard at all from the PSW10 at any volume. Interestingly enough, the weaker PSW10 was actually very noticeably louder than the PSW110 at the same volume levels but muffled. The 110 articulated instead sounding so much more soothing instead of disturbing.\n\nThe 8\" PSW111 (150W RMS), the Best Buy tech and I both agreed, also sounded immediately fuller than the PSW10 but less than the 110, and quieter than both. I checked again to make sure the volumes and phase were all the same on all three. So, the PSW111 didn't seem worth considering for any reason at any price.\n\nWe are using 4 floor standing speakers (Polk TSi300) and center speaker. But, I really can't imagine satellite speakers being a good match for the PSW10 either because of it's missing range. I can imagine it enhancing the short boom movie type sounds that might not sound too distorted with satellites. But it still wouldn't fill in the entire void satellites have also. So, satellites would actually need a higher range subwoofer to crossover the entire gap evenly.\n\nThe best Polk sub in their PSW level is the 12\" PSW125 (150W RMS), according to Polk's website. The CEA 2010 rating (which measures decibels at 10% distortion) gives it only a 3.5 decibel advantage though on both the high and low end compared to their second best PSW110. So, with these two considerations (PSW110 and PSW125), Polk needs to drop their other PSW level subs.\n\nBoth Amazon(refurbished) and Newegg(new) had the PSW110 with postage for $150. And the PSW125, on Amazon, was $250. Since the 12\" PSW125 is only barely better, and if the price of a 12\" is going to cost $100 more, it really should be replaced with a 200W version. 'PSW112' could be an appropriate name.\n\n2014 April update\nI ended up getting a 10\" 300W RMS Acoustic Audio HD-SUB10 on special for $135 total from some website I've never heard of before and have been surprisingly impressed with it. I'm very satisfied with it's power, articulation, and note range in both movies and music, and have had no problems with it.\n\nIt's power is probably comparable to other typical 200W & 150W units, and assume it to be at least comparable to the quality sound of Polk's PSW125 (150W).\n\nI would not recommend Acoustic Audio's HD-SUB12 and 15 units though, as their 400W and 500W power doesn't seem proportionally high enough to drive those cone sizes and perform as well as their 10\" HD-SUB10 does -from reading others' reviews. Acoustic Audio should instead put their 500W power driver into their 12 inch.\n\n2015: March update\nThe Acoustic Audio HD-SUB10 died after about a year and a half. For no apparent reason, it hums a strong volume, medium frequency, base sound with no other sound. The hum does not change by making adjustments to the cable connection, volume, frequency knobs, phase, or off/auto/on buttons.\n\nAnybody know what's wrong with it? I opened it up and see 50W and 60W written on the equipment instead of the claimed 300W. But it did sound a lot stronger than Polk's 50W."}, "194": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "I bought this as a gift and he loved it! It arrived really quickly.

After a few weeks of normal use, here are my thoughts;\n\nFirst, this subwoofer is very responsive and clean.  I have used it listening to  music, gaming and watching movies and in every different genre it performs with clean sound, if tuned properly with volume & cut off settings.  It gets the lows quite well and does not lag behind during any sequences in an action films or in any songs that I have listened to.  I am highly impressed with how clean it sounds.\n\nSecondly I would like to comment on the volume.  Some people indicate this would only be for small and maybe some medium sized rooms.  That was the main thing I was nervous about when researching subs and considering this one.  Would it fill my living room (and connected rooms all open space) with clean sound?  I might disagree slightly that it's only for small/medium sized rooms.  I feel that it would be well suited if properly placed in medium to large rooms, within consideration of course.  I have a living room, dining room, kitchen and entry that are all open and connected and make a considerable square footage, and it does a very good job of filling the entire living room and connected rooms too with clean deep bass. I currently have the cut off turned all the way up to bypass the crossover, and I have the volume just over half way.\n\nSo in closing I would highly recommend this sub for good clean deep bass that can round out your sound system, and for most, exceed your expectations.  I sometimes feel that I could turn down the sub just under half way and still get plenty of volume for my setup.  I would highly recommend this sub for most any setup that I can think of!

Some are big, and some are small, but most are cubes or boxes of some sort. Catch is, they don't all sound the same. We've heard our share of boomy, muddy-sounding subs, and while they sometimes click with home theater, the boomier models fall to pieces when they attempt to reproduce the nuanced sound of a stand-up bass. That's why we were so jazzed about Polk's most affordable sub, the $199 PSW10: it pounds out home-theater thrills and musical bass with equal prowess.\n\nThe PSW10 has a 10-inch composite woofer and a 50-watt high-current amplifier. Yes, we know that some of you are probably snickering over the skimpy power rating, but we'd urge an audition before you dismiss this sub. We found its bass power definitely up to snuff. For connectivity, you get stereo speaker-level inputs and outputs as well as RCA line-level inputs. All that's missing is a direct/LFE input that bypasses the onboard 80Hz-to-160Hz crossover control. We prefer direct inputs because they make it easier to blend the sound of satellites and the subwoofer, but we didn't have any problems matching the PSW10 with Polk's Monitor 30 satellite speakers.\n\nThis is a fairly compact subwoofer, just 14.5 inches high, 14 inches wide, and 15 inches deep; thanks mostly to its robustly constructed MDF (medium-density fiberboard) cabinet, it weighs a hefty 26 pounds. The PSW10 is available in black or cherry-colored vinyl, and its titanium-finish front baffle matches that of the other Monitor Series speakers. The extended warranty offers five years of protection on the woofer and three years on the electronics--pretty decent considering that the electronics warranty on many other products is often limited to just 12 months.\n\nThe PSW10's deep-bass capabilities were impressive, but its definition and control on the Blue Man Group's new DVD-Audio disc, The Complex, were really special. The Blue Men's drums and percussion-heavy instrumentals lose impact on muddy-sounding subs. But the PSW10 delivered every thump and rumble with the utmost clarity. That said, it will do its best work in small to moderate-size rooms. If you want to feel the bass in larger spaces, check out the PSW10's bigger sibling, the PSW12.\n\nSo,there are alot of people who say \"no tight enough\",yet CNET said it was a decent Sub woofer for the money!\n."}, "223": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Would buy again.

Set the cross over on my stereo (Pioneer VSX-521-K) to 80Hz. Adjusted the volume to about half (fills my 17' x 20' Living/Dining Room combo nicely). Never heard it distort at this level and seems to blend nicely with my tower speakers.\n\nPros:\nInexpensive - not cheap because this thing looks and feels nicely built\nGood Sound for both movies and music - after the initial break in period. The bass was non-existent at lower volumes before it broke in. Now it hit nicely no matter what the volume is.\nGreat for apartment living - not overly powerful, so it will satisfy the bass craving while not getting you in trouble with your neighbors\n\nCons:\nDoes have \"muddy\" bass at times - a few people mention it being too loud at times and I agree. There are times when this thing seems to be louder than it should, but not often enough for it to bother me. When it does seem louder, it does produce \"muddy\" bass.\nAuto Sleep function happens too quickly - wish this thing didn't auto-shut off when watching a TV show\n\nIf you are on a tight budget like I was, this is a great choice.

Recently, however, I noticed that my subwoofer (an old Sony powered sub that came with a home theater in a box years ago) was starting to show it's age.  It wasn't sounding as good as it once had, and as I upgraded to better components all around, the sub had become the weak point of my system.\n\nBeing budget minded, I set about trying to find a replacement that wouldn't break the bank, wouldn't overpower the rest of my system, and would both look and sound good.\n\nThe Polk PSW10 does both of these, and does them well.\n\nWhen I first got the sub, I set up the system with the sub in the same location.  I immediately felt a bit disappointed, as the Polk didn't seem to sound as loud as the Sony had.  With my DVDs and music that I used to test the system, it just didn't seem like it was hitting as hard as the old Sony had, despite the fact that the Polk had much better specifications.\n\nIt wasn't until my wife came into the room and asked why I had the bass so loud that I realized...the Polk WAS louder, it just didn't seem as loud because it was cleaner and less distored.\n\nOnce I had that out of the way, I set about tweaking the system to match my speakers, and I love the results that I ended up with.  For music, I can adjust the level of the sub on my receiver and have it absolutely pound for music with heavy bass, or I can adjust the level to a more flat and natural response for watching movies and TV.  These were things that didn't seem to make as dramatic of a difference with my old subwoofer, and it's nice to be able to hit a few buttons on a remote and have the subwoofer's sound changed to match whatever it is that I'm currently listening to.\n\nI'm using the subwoofer with it's crossover basically canceled out, as my receiver has a better crossover in it anyways.  I've found that the subwoofer seems to hit the low frequencies exactly as it should, and it definitely provides good bass response.  Mated with some Sony SSB3000 bookshelf speakers for my front mains, my sound range is incredible, considering the cost of these two products.  The Polk sub does the frequencies that the Sonys don't very well, and it complements the Sonys lower frequencies very well without overpowering the lower-midrange frequencies.\n\nOverall, I can't say enough good things about this speaker.

Each of the other seven speakers in the system turn on and off with the receiver, of course, but the subwoofer never does.  It separately plugs into an outlet and processes sound sent to it from the receiver whenever that occurs, always on and ready.  I cannot know, of course, if leaving my now discarded P.O.S. subwoofer plugged in and turned on at all times, as it necessarily was, shortened its life.

But if you want to listen to music, well...\nI was able to adjust the crossover and volume to make it sound acceptable for classical cello music -- to add some warmth, depth and resonance. It was actually quite nice for that. But for pop, rock, dance, etc, the way music is equalized, it simply demands more from a woofer than this is capable of providing. I had to turn the dials way down to keep it from muddying the sound completely. In the end, I just unplugged it for those types of music.

[Note on wiring: my receiver has no sub outputs so I had to wire everything through the sub's crossover using&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Monster-QuickLock-MKII-Gold-Flex-Pin-Connectors-For-Easy-Self-Crimping-Terminations-2-pr/dp/B000WXBY7I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Monster QuickLock MKII Gold Flex Pin Connectors For Easy Self Crimping Terminations - 2 pr</a>. It was easy enough. Use a run of speaker wire from your amp to the sub, and then another run from the sub to the main speakers].\n\nSome reviewers complained of booming muddy bass from this unit. I experienced this at first, so I moved the sub around the room in different positions and at different sub volume settings. Every room, amp, and set of speakers brings a bunch of variables to positioning, so take a few hours to work out the kinks. My particular listening room is very small (10' x 10') and anything above the 4th increment on the sub's volume just destroys the music. That being said, CD's and downloaded music also vary in quality and mixing. I recommend placing the sub in such a way that you can always access the back panel to make adjustments.\n\nCONCLUSION: So far, I definitely think I got more than my money's worth. If you have small speakers, an old system, or you just want to add a little zip to your musical experience, I say this is a great place to start. I can hear new dimensions on my CDs, and the main speakers sound much more spacious and clear."}, "503": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "This sub sounds amazing in my 1k square ft apt.

It's fine for home theater use but horrible for music as it's just too boomy and muddy at the 30HZ low end it can reach.

The Y-adapter will make the sub louder, but this can be just as easily accomplished by turning up the volume on the back the of the sub or in the receiver's settings.

If you really get some intense bass going at a louder level, this causes you to be able to hear the air coming out of the port. This detracts from the sound and I think the port needs to be a little bigger in diameter and placed in the back. You don't see that many front firing subwoofers with the port in the front. Sub also isn't magnetically shielded, so you probably don't want to have this sitting right next to your TV.\n\nI think this is a very good option for anybody wanting a sub that obviously doesn't want to spend a lot of money. Of course there are better options for more $$, but in the under $100 range this is a winner. I opted for the cherry over the black despite everything in my entertainment center being black.

Subwoofers are omnidirectional, but placement has a huge effect on the quality of sound you get out of it.  Make sure you try it at different distances from the wall and even in corners before making an opinion about the sound.  The one complaint about this sub is that it doesn't have a huge \"sweet spot\" as far as the volume knob is concerned.  This sub really starts to blossom once you've turned it up about half way.  However, at about three-quarters up it starts to get really distorted and boomy.  That is the drawback of buying a $100 or less entry-level sub.  Don't get me wrong, though.  In the range that this sub sounds its best, it sounds really, really good.  You will feel the bass when watching a movie or listening to a good cd.  I think most people will find that it's loud enough.  This sub will definitely be appreciated in most setups.  If you have a $10,000 system then why would you cheap out and buy a 50 watt, $100 subwoofer?  If you have a $1,000 system, then get ready to rock like you never have before.  I loved this sub for the week or so that I owned it.  I ended up sending it back because I ended up having more of a budget than I anticipated having when I bought it and I found a great price on the Polk PSW505 (also on Amazon).  That one hasn't been delivered yet.  I was satisfied with the PSW10, but since I could suddenly afford the more powerful PSW505 I had to buy it as it will still be fine if I upgrade my receiver and other speakers.  Anyway, if your budget is under $175 you will not find a better subwoofer than this Polk Audio PSW10.  It is very musical and adds a lot to your overall sound experience.

With this setup and decent equilizer settings i have it at about 30-40% volume in order for it to still be a flat response with the rest of the speakers since its daisy chained, showing (and having tested) that the bass will overcome everything at 100% and shake and rattle a small to medium room as much as desired.  So since the price has dropped and it's good to make sure it's a matching sub if you get a second, i just got another one of these to pair with my first so that the bass is more spread out evenly. (even though you can't localize the sub by sound.. you sure can feel it stronger on one side of the walls, couch, etc. so having two really helps balance out the feel).\n  I have these subs paired with a few Cerwin Vega speakers from the VE line and they are all connected to an old Carver receiver.  The cerwin vegas are pairs of the ve-8 and the ve-5 so those woofers aren't quite big enough on their own to hit lower frequencies with much power, so these subs are a must to hear and feel the lower notes that are usually missed out on for most people's listening experiences.\n\nI only give it a 4/5 and not a 5/5 because it is 10 inches, and thus doesnt have subsonic or even 20-30 hz range hitting so there are SOME sounds you never hear but for a 10 inch at $90 its much better than making the few hundred dollar jump to the next level of bass response in a sub.\n\nAlso, 50 watts is plenty as i have it set to 30-40% volume ... intensity is logarithmic so paying extra for double wattage is not double volume; double volume requires 10x the wattage, so 50 watts self powers is plenty for an active sub like this."}, "617": {"helpfulness": "2", "rating": 5.0, "text": "I was looking for a sub to add to my home-theater and home-audio setup without spending too much.  I appreciate quality audio, but I'm also fine with getting along with inexpensive gear as long as it sounds good enough.  This sub definitely falls into that category.\n\nAs with any speakers, and especially subwoofers, placement is key.  Low-frequency sound radiates with a pattern that is much closer to \"in every direction\" than the higher-frequency sound that your main speakers produce.  That means that the optimal place for this sub is probably not pointed straight at you.  The room that you place it in will have a large impact on how loud it is, and *where* it is loud.  For starters, try placing the sub in a corner.  If you cannot place it in a corner, place it against a wall.  If aesthetics allow, experiment with pointing the driver towards the wall, or into a corner... depending on the room and what objects are in it, this can amplify the bass.\n\nAlso, don't forget the phase switch.  After you have found your sub placement, have someone help you out by switching the phase between 0* and 180* while you sit in the main listening area.  One of the settings will be louder!\n\nThis unit has only a single drawback (that I've found so far):  it has no true \"off\" setting; you have to unplug it to get that effect.  The \"auto-power-on\" mode is a little liberal for my taste... for some reason, it is almost always on.  If you are concerned with energy consumption, you should be aware of this.  The sub doesn't draw that much power even when turned up loud, though--maybe 10-15 Watts from the wall (1 second averaged--instantaneous peak draw is likely much higher, but I don't have a meter fast enough to report that)."}, "618": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "I purchased this sub to fill out my computer's audio set up.

Though it is capable of 'doing the job' if you crank it up, it should be noted fairly that really low end bass doesn't necessarily sound 'muddy', just that it appears to be moreso an issue of too much port noise and resonance the harder you push it (watch this video if you need a better example: [...]/user/FIcaraudioBTL#p/u/25/1DXk6nkQous).\n\nThis is a subwoofer for the average music lover who doesn't require a subwoofer to \"bring down the house\" and it will do fine with most music, but if you are looking for a really heavy low end, you might want to consider a 12\" model which has a little bit more powerful of an amp, though for most I still think this will do very well and above expectation.\n\nI listen to many styles of music (mainly rock), and I have this paired with Bose 301 series V bookshelf speakers and an Onkyo TX-SR500 receiver.

I have read some turn it up all the way, which I find insane because you don't need bass that heavy to be drowning out your music. Half volume can earn you complaints.\n\nDon't be fooled by the amplifier rating at 50 Watts...it sounds much better than my previous 10\" subwoofer that was downfiring and had 120 Watts.\n\nBottom line, give it a buy and if you don't like the sound, there is always the return option."}, "678": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Set this Sub up right and it will do it's job.

This, my friends, is a product that has immense value.\n\nTo give you an idea of what I mean by value, my previous set-up had KLH Subwoofers that were so under-rated and unknown that it wasn't until I spoke of them that people even considered them as KLH (being that KLH, for some unknown reason, has a bad name. Now, by no means would I consider myself cheap...I like value--inexpensive items that do as they say while preserving quality. Being that Matt Polk put the name of the Polk legacy on these, the quality should not be in question at any point.\n\nI think the only reason that these are at such a reduced rate is because of their meager ratings (50-Watt amp and 10\" woofer...something else that is unattractive is the front facing port--don't they know that most new speakers come with the port to the rear to avoid port noise??!!) and, even moreso, reviewing its bigger brothers and sisters with downward firing ports means that although this sub isn't in the same class, there are offerings for more discerning listeners. If I had a good $1000 to blow on subwoofers, I would have probably bought two of the PSW110s without question...\n\nAh, yes...TWO.\n\nThe biggest reason that I look for subwoofers of value is so that I can purchase more than one (if you were wondering why I keep using these nouns in the plural). Although I am still relatively young <30y/o, I've been into home theater since the days when there was no such thing as Home-Theater-In-a-Box and Definitive Technology illuminated the minds of young, aspiring audiophiles with diagrams of their BP3000s tower speakers with built in 300-Watt Amplifiers and 15\" Sub-/Woofers. Ah yes...those good ol' days...\n\nNow, Home Theater is the standard and it may be difficult to discern one product from another (trust me, most of it is trash--INCLUDING BOSE). The best way to go about building a theater system is not by adhering to the one-click feature-like HTiB. Piece by piece...step by step... It helps to buy speakers in a particular company's model family since they are normally making use of the same drivers and are normally tonally matched. Many companies claim their speakers as tonally matched without considering the effects of the difference in enclosure size and construction of a center channel and a satellite... Ah...that's info for you--but not why I'm writing this review...\n\nThis review is about the two Polk Audio 10PSWs sitting here in front of me.\n\nThey sound awesome for what they are. I'm glad that an earlier reviewer made it known that the 50w amplifier is continuously rated--not instantly...or even rated considering a massive amount of Total Harmonic Distortion--as many companies do and then say \"@ 1KHz\"...who sits home listening to 1KHz Sine signals?? At loud volumes even? Don't be fooled. Normally they follow that spec up with \"30-20KHz +/-3db\" As many of you probably know...that's HALF the power that they're quoting it at...3db = 1/2 Wattage (or twice the wattage considering the context...normally, it's LESS, not MORE).\n\nMany of you, I'm sure, have bought one of these and are either loving it or hating it (most loving from what I can tell). Indeed, with the varying types of music and source program I use, these fit the bill nicely. The sound is present...strong...detailed. I haven't experienced the muddy sound as other people have noted. I'm sure that it's not just luck...I have two...surely, one would be muddy if this was prevalent.\n\nNow, time for pointers (I love the reviewers who leave pointers...it's normally the nudge for most people to consider a truly awesome product--as this one is)\n\nPointer#1: Buy Two (2)\n\nThese are probably some of the least expensive, best sounding subs you can get right now. When in the market for a sub, you should at least have a budget of $200--$400 even...otherwise, you'll find yourself wondering what you paid for... Remember, there are materials (wood, cables), components (subwoofer driver, subwoofer amplifier), and labor that goes into that bass machine. If any of these things aren't optimally constructed, the overall device will suffer. You can understand this, I'm sure. The flip side of this, is that surely, there was a corner cut somewhere. Thus, why continue to hammer out your amplifier? The amp is often overlooked in all of this. Most people see the pretty cone of their subwoofer and totally disregard the reality that the real work horse of the build is the amplifier.\n\nHaving two subs is not for more bass...but to conserve the life of the subwoofers you have. In addition, when the time comes to party or watch a movie, you don't have to worry about your subs (the drivers themselves) bottoming out or sounding as if they're straining. Thus, with two, you get the benefit of both worlds (longevity, present sound quality). Electronics have limitations...use them wisely and they will perform AND last a very long time...\n\nPointer #2: Gain >1/2\n\nYou should never have to turn your amplifier gain past half. Past half is where distortion and clipping are introduced. Sure, depending on your source, this may not be prevalent, but if you have a good, strong signal, there will come a time when you hear artifacts that weren't intended for reproduction (e.g. distortion, clipping). As a rule, if you have to turn your sub past half, you might want to adjust your settings in your receiver or see Pointer #1 again... A benefit of two, is that the both of them can be readjusted lower to account for the assistance or each other. My Polks are each at about 1/3 (and that's only because I really enjoy the sound right now...so I'm excited...otherwise they would each be at 1/4). The reason you only want \"enough\" volume is because headroom is what you want... this is the power that is used during explosions, kick drums--sudden bursts...this is what you bought it for, right?\n\nYes, that's right. I know that there are many other reviewers--bless their heart--who are praising having it just past half or 3/4 of the way up. Mine are at 1/3 and it was like that when I only had one connected. Now that I have both connected, I'll have to half the volume of both of them to equal the volume of the one (and no, the gain knob potentiometers are not linear, so it'll have to be by ear).\n\nPointer #3: Subs Fill, Not Dominate\n\nSubwoofer modules are only meant to fill in where the other speakers in your system fail. My set-up has Mirage towers as my mains. However, the built in crossover of my Harmon/Kardon handles all bass traffic well--cut off at 60Hz (the point where bass can not be located by the human ear). Having the setting higher than this will not only put more stress on your sub but also the amplifier (lets not forget the amp). When adjusting the gain, you just want to ensure that the frequencies from the sub are at around the same volume as your main speakers. This will keep you from being bass hungry. That's not the point of a sub...this isn't a mobile system...this is home. The environment doesn't warrant that level of \"hyper-bass\"... If done this way, you will be able to reach higher sound pressure levels while retaining your dynamism...\n\nThese pointers should help with any sub...this sub is truly a great, great buy...\n\nHope this helps..."}, "703": {"helpfulness": "0", "rating": 5.0, "text": "Great sounding speaker for the money ($100).

Let's be clear: This subwoofer is perfect for what it is: An entry-level subwoofer for small to mid-sized rooms. Anyone who expects this thing to defibrillate their heart or rattle the photos off the wall are kidding themselves. Likewise, no one should expect that this one subwoofer is going to saturate a large room with high levels of bass. It's just not made for that!\n\nWhat I WILL say is that this subwoofer works very well in small to medium-sized rooms IF it's set up in the ideal way. It took me a fair amount of tweaking to get this sub sounding the way I wanted without it rattling its own case during bassy parts of films. READ THIS: If you don't have it in the best place in your room AND it's trying to pump out too much, it WILL rattle undesirably. Also, if you don't set the optimal cross-over frequency for your speaker system, it definitely may sound \"boomy.\"\n\nAt first, I had this sub right next to my TV stand and it was set to the highest frequency on the crossover selector in order to let the receiver handle the crossover -- which, that setting also needed tweaking, too. (By the way, I have the sub connected via the RCA connector.) The sub DID sound boomy. The sub DID distort and rattle. It DID NOT sound like I wanted it to.\n\nSince then, I've moved it to the corner of our medium-sized finished basement room, facing the listening position. I toggled the phase switch to hear which setting sounds better. I've also tweaked the crossover frequency in the receiver (120Hz in my case, but your results may vary). Those three adjustments have led me to turn DOWN the sub and get MORE sound out of it when the LFE channel of my movies gets active. And I get plenty of bass that way without distortion.\n\nIf you get the PSW10 set up and end up not liking the sound, work with it. Move it around and listen to the differences. Tweak the crossover frequency on the back and maybe even in your receiver. Toggle the phase switch to see which side sounds best.\n\nRome wasn't built in a day, but once it was it was grand.

I also have the sound powered by an Onkyo head unit with 2 channels up front and a center speaker, all in all very exceptional sound by itself but my movies were lacking depth.\n\nLast year I purchased this sub-woofer at HH Gregg for $150, it was 200 at Best Buy. I can't remember if it came with rca cables or not. It was easy to hook up, it came with directions to install with multiple configurations and the best place to set it.  That was good for me because although I had an idea where it needed to be, it confirmed my thoughts on the location.  It doesn't seem like a lot(50 watts rms)but it is really awesome for a few reasons...\n\n-first, I had to turn the volume down to about 60% because the windows in my house were rattling(1500 Square Foot house)so 60% works well.  I still have to keep any glasses or candle holders from touching within 15 feet from the stereo to keep things from vibrating.\n-Also you can adjust the frequency, meaning you can have the sound very low and rumbly like a space shuttle taking off, or you can turn the frequency higher so it responds to a bit higher noise like a bass guitar or a muscle car.  Either way I played with it through a few action movies(makes Matrix wake up) to get the right setting, I'm somewhere in the lower middle because my normal speakers have a wide range as it is.\n-It has an auto setting so it only turns on when there is sound going through the RCA cables so you don't have to worry about turning it off or wasting electricity.\n\nIf you have thousands invested in your home system, invest in the same quality sub.  But, if you want to triple your movie experience and have a basic or starter 5.1/7.1, go with this one.  I have no regrets.  It will chatter so-to-speak under loud bass scenes if it is turned to 100% and the main volume is way high, but most people won't do that unless they just want to rattle their fillings.

It's pretty good and if you aren't too concerned with perfect quality it's a great choice. The only thing is that it just can't handle the low lows. It flutters and sounds terrible but most music doesn't have these frequencies anyway. Rap and hip-hop might be an area of concern but anything else should be in the clear. Another thing is if you want it to be VERY loud it isn't going to sound good. It gets very muddy and you can hear the sub fluttering when you crank it but again this isn't a huge concern.

It is not put out through the speaker outputs. They are just there if you want to wire the system in another way.

I wanted to have something better but I'm in college so I couldn't afford it. If you have a higher budget go for something that handles a lower frequency range. The audible frequency range is from about 20-20,000Hz. This sub is said to be able to handle down to 35Hz but I don't think it sounds good even there.

This was adequate for video watchng and game playing and even did okay for most music, but it really showed it's limits there.  However, I recently upgraded my home theater AVR to a better one (Onkyo TX-SR707) and decided to use my old AVR for my PC with the old Klipsch speakers (I cobbled together a 20 year old Pioneer receiver to drive the Klipsch sub unit).  This performed better than the Logitech unit until the Klipsch Sub unit blew the speakers.

After some analysis, I concluded that this noise has two components: a vibration from the power supply transformer that seems to be amplified by the enclosure, and hum from the woofer itself.

First, LFE's:  I have an ancient Dolby Digital reciever, so perhaps this is not the norm anymore, but mine has a setting for sending the LFE's directly to the speakers.  As such, it is not a problem at all to get this subwoofer to play the LFE's and by using the crossover control, to determine how much of those LFE's you want played by the sub vs. the rest of the speakers.  I can't remember for sure at this point, but I think I have the cross-over set to around 100 Hz.  Second, volume:  I know CNET stated that it has more than enough oomph, despite the low listed power rating, but I want to emphasize this once more.  Turned up past 50% volume this sub is simply more than you could sanely need.  I don't know what the other more expensive subs are giving you over this one, because it is capable of overkill while still being plenty sensitive and melodic for the purposes of listening to music.  Finally, I would like to note that it has an On, Off, and Auto power mode.  I hadn't noticed this mentioned in any of the formal reviews, and would have liked to know that.  My old sub had only an auto mode, and it annoyed me when it popped on and off during quiet scenes in movies.  That said, this sub works flawlessly on auto if it is fed via the front satellite speaker wires - they are never going to be quiet during a movie, so there's basically no possibility for the sub ever powering down except once it makes sense to do so.\n\nGet it.

Size and shape were both top considerations, as we wanted to integrate the subwoofer into a window seat in our great room, so the unit had to be approximately 14\" tall (precluding several other, bigger, more powerful choices).  Price was a secondary consideration -- but we do appreciate good sound, and would have happily paid more for better sound, if we could get the packaging right.\n\nAs always with Amazon, shipping was very efficient and the speakers arrived in good shape long before we were actually ready to install them in the new house.  Set up was no-brainer easy (as others have noted, the lack of an LFE input is easily worked around by turning the crossover level of the speakers all the way up).  We routed a 20-foot RCA cable along the base of our hearth prior to installing hardwood flooring, so the terminal end could be routed behind the drywall to the final installation spot, tucked into the window seat in the very corner of the room.  Remember, though, that as a powered subwoofer, you'll also need a close-by AC outlet.\n\nNow, for the sound:  it's really good -- crisp, not excessively boomy unless you turn the internal volume way up, and surprisingly capable of churning out satisfying bass in a very large space.  Our primary listening environment is a large great room, approximately 32 feet by 24 feet, with a two-story cathedral ceiling.  The primary speakers are Audioplex 8\" in-wall speakers, driven by a Yamaha RX-663 receiver.  Most of our usage in this room is for \"ambient\" music during the day, running in the receiver's 7-channel stereo mode -- and the Polk PSW10 admirably \"fills out\" the bottom end of the sound, enriching it without being distracting or boomy.\n\nWe also use this system for family movie nights, in concert with a Samsung 52\" A650 LCD monitor.  Once again, the PSW10 does a fine job \"filling out\" the bottom end with solid bass, even keeping up with the action-adventure movies my kids prefer.  As a minor beef, I actually have had to get up and turn down the sub's volume during a couple movies because the level that works well with music is a little too much boom during loud action sequences... which I suppose says something about the sound levels this little speaker is capable of.\n\nOverall, for the way we live (lots of music played at moderate volumes, regular \"home theater\" sessions with the whole family on the couch), the Polk PSW10s have proven to be a great buy and a great value, with satisfying performance in a right-sized package.

Taking off the screen covering the port helps a little, but not enough to complete solve the port noise.  Again this doesn't happen very often, but when it does it can be somewhat annoying.\n\nMy second complaint, very minor, which other people have touched upon is that there is no LFE input which you will find on nearly every other sub.

Great bass with no distortion (just don't go nuts with the volume). It suffers at the very low range but what budget sub doesn't. Main problem is the lack of an LFE input.\n\nHere is the solution from Polk: Use the RCA inputs and turn the frequency knob clockwise, this will essentially create and LFE connection.\n\nOne unrelated Polk story:  I recently moved to Austin, Texas. I had left my Polk audio home theater in Galveston. A prick named Ike came in and flooded my storage, submerging my Polks under sludge. When I got to them I noticed the water line was halfway up the tower speakers.\nHoping beyond hope I brought the smelly mess up to Austin where I took them apart and tried to clean and dry them out.

A true audiophile, if they have a subwoofer at all, will drop 2- to 3 grand on a Velodyne, Rega, Rel, etc. and then complain if they can't hear fingernails plucking the strings of a double bass.  Next, the low frequencies produced in a movie are inherently different than those produced in music.  Getting a subwoofer to reproduce both equally well can be tricky.  My review of the PSW10 is from a 2-speaker, mid-level audio system perspective and not a 7/5.1 surround-sound home theater.  I'm NOT saying the -10 won't work well in a HT set-up, but suggest you may need to use 2 different settings (see below).\n\nThis subwoofer will give you tight, punchy bass for most music genres.  I used jazz, alt country, indie rock, and a little hip-hop to get my settings.  The key here is to spend time during burn-in to get your crossover, phase and volume controls all married together.  Once I found the right crossover setting, I learned that a little volume goes a long way with the PSW10.  As many other reviewers have noted, too much volume will shake your walls with deep, boomy, unintelligible bass.  You may want some of that for an action movie, but not so much for music.  Next, I used the line-in with RCA's first, then swapped-out those for some heavy-duty Monster 10 gauge at the speaker-level connection.  Jury's still out on which sounds better.  Finally, if you're placing your sub on anything other than carpet (hardwood floor, ceramic tile, or even a shelf) seriously consider swapping-out the cheapo nailed-in feet.  I have hardwood flooring, so I screwed in some nice 2\" legs with dampers between the box and risers, and hard rubber pads making contact with the floor.  Probably has a small positive sonic effect, and actually looks a lot nicer sitting up like that, too.\n\nLastly, got mine at [...], with free shipping.  For that price, the PSW10 is a no-brainer.

Otherwise the sound is very smooth with the exception of port turbulence at certain frequencies, you know that annoying noise that sounds like a piece of paper is flapping inside the box, but this is typically only at really low frequencies anyway.

I already had a pair of Polk Audio Monitor 50s that I really enjoy, but without the sub, the low bass--for example, of the piano--was cloudy.  This sub provides excellent bass clarity and warmth for classical music.  Even the treble and midrange sounds better against the foundation that the sub provides.  In a modestly sized living room with hardwood floors, this speaker combination is just right.  If you are placing your sub close to a television set or computer, buy the SW12 instead of the 10, because the 12 has magnetic shielding that the 10 lacks.  My TEAC Reference Series tuner does not have a sub out, but that was no problem.  The sub comes with a diagram (use option 2) for wiring the sub to the amp and the L/R speakers through the sub.  It uses a little more speaker wire, but it allows those without a sub out the option of adding the sub.  I am very pleased with the results.  For the price, it is hard for me to imagine a better solution.

I bought the black here on amazon for $101 free shipping.  The subwoofer itself is large and bulky.  Mine is hidden behind my TV stand which also made it easy to plug into the receiver.  I only needed a 3 foot Monster subwoofer cable which I bought on ebay for $7.  Most receivers have a dedicated subwoofer connection which is where you plug in the cable, the other end of the cable plugs into either the 'L' or 'R' connection on the subwoofer.  Turn the frequency response dial all the way up on the subwoofer to cancel it out since your receiver will control this.\n\nThis subwoofer provides plenty of tight punchy base which can be easily heard throughout the whole house.  Explosions during a movie and even just plain music is alot more enjoyable now.  I do not see why a more powerful subwoofer than this is needed for the average user with a basic sized room.  Unless you have a mansion or are addicted to loud ear-deafening bass, this will be all you need.  If I do feel the need to make the bass more powerful, there is a volume knob on the subwoofer itself or a volume adjustment on the receiver.  I like to use the receiver to adjust the power of this subwoofer while watching a movie.  Most modern day receivers will let you control the volume of one speaker at a time.  Some people might want to hide this subwoofer behind their couch but then you have to buy a 12 or 16 foot subwoofer cable and run it under the carpet or hide it somehow.  It's easier to just keep the subwoofer in the front of the room if possible.  Overall, nice product and well made by Polk.

Those of you who worry about no LFE input, that shouldn't be a problem. All you have to do is connect the sub-woofer output of the receiver to either the right or left input on the sub-woofer. And then set the variable low pass filter on the sub-woofer to the highest setting. This will set the internal low pass filter above the low pass filter frequency given by your receiver and create an LFE input. Or you may use a RCA cable to provide a connection to both inputs on the sub-woofer from the LR pre-out from the receiver. Then adjust the cross over frequency from the woofer as desired. It sounds a little louder and better for me. I bought Monster sub-woofer cable and it sounds no better than RCA cable. Try not to waste your money on this. It has 7.4 out of 10 in CNet rating and it is #6 in editor's top list for sub-woofers. I matched PSW10 with R300, RTi4, R150, CSi3 and Denon 1906 receiver.
